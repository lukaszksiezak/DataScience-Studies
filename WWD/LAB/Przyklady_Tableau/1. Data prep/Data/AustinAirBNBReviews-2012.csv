I wanted a quieter place than downtown and I wanted to be running distance to Zilker park- it was perfect and There are tennis courts accross the street! Austin is an outdoor city so being near the park and near the river was exactly what I wanted. But even more importantlu Lisa was the PERFECT hostess!! I could not have asked for more. I ran off to buy half and half before I checked the fridge- she had already stocked up for us!! Juice wine flavored and regular half and half and tea and coffee! and great advice on bars- loved bar ilegal and clives!!

78974,828116,1/2/2012,Denise,My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay during New Year's Eve weekend.  Dan's private apartment was cozy quiet and relaxing!  It had all of the necessary things that we needed for our 2 day stay.  And Dan is such a wonderful host. He's warm and friendly and made us feel at home.  He gave us our privacy but also made himself available in case we needed anything.  He even stocked our fridge with a few snacks.  Our linens and towels smelled great!  The futon was comfortable and we slept so well.  Since it was chilly in Austin he had a heater and extra blankets for us just in case we needed them.  I forgot my sweater and jacket in the closet because we were in a rush to head out.  Dan called me right away to let me know.  He's a great guy! , 78704 Detached Garden  Cottage ,424835,Dan

When we got into her home she had provided us with a map with some key locations highlighted a cable channel listing for the TV a bottle of Champagne (we were there over New Years) and coffee. Her place was very cute clean and comfortable. She even tolereated our dogs (which they greatly appreciated!!) We would definately stay there again.

The room was as described.  The kitchenette area was small so don't expect to prepare any feasts but it's good for storing and heating up leftovers.  Yes as another reviewer pointed out someone was living in a separate space upstairs and we heard them walking around occasionally but we never saw them.

This cozy apartment was very convenient to downtown school campus Zilker Park capitol building etc. because the bus stop is just down a block. What made Andi's place great was that it had a kitchen that I could cook in since we were staying for 4 nights. Pots and pans and utensils were readily available and the bathroom shower ran wonderfully. I hate going to hotels where the water pressure is low. She even had bath towels.

After a hectic day I was immediately relieved seeing their bungalow. Not only is it in a really great location (near all the 6th Street East Austin fun) but the bungalow itself is gorgeous and incredibly cozy. It had everything that one would need and I especially loved the considerations for the environment (recycling and a water heater/conserver). The very best part of my stay however was meeting Edie and Alberto. I was in Austin for just a brief time and they had so much great advice and are really interesting warm people.

The photos of the casita are beautiful but actually being in the space and staying there was divine. As I explored the place and all it's charms and thoughtfulness laid out by our host Dolina I was more excited to stay here in the Casita than to explore the city the evening I arrived. Hunger eventually drove me out and I was within a short 5 minute or less drive to Downtown/6th street Zilker Park a mile from the heart of SoCo. UT was about a 10-15 minute drive. I could not image a better location close enough to everything I wanted to visit but not waking up to people trampling across the sidewalks of the casita like some places. I would definitely recommend the Casita to friends and family. I even started to feel guilty for not bring an extra friend to share the experience with us.

- The space is very cool. The three futons mean that it could sleep a lot of people if necessary although it is a great size for 2. It is well located not too far from downtown but in a quiet neighborhood. A great place to rest. Furthermore the house definitely channels the ""keep Austin weird"" vibe which is really fun.

69810,883084,1/25/2012,Ada,"We had a wonderful stay at the Birdhouse. Like other guests have mentioned the pictures don't do it justice - there are many beautiful and thoughtful details that my friend and I kept finding and were obsessing over (we are both designers so notice these things!). Like the fact that the kitchen cabinet doors are shallow enough to stay clear of your head when open the impeccable floorplan and layout the dark penny tiles in the bathroom way the shower curtain is cut to fit perfectly in the shower and has little suction cups to keep it from billowing around. Oh and the basket of treats - organic chocolate tea and coffee. The meticulous attention to detail makes you feel like you're being taken care of so that you can simply relax and enjoy being there.
Dolina and her family were super nice and helpful hosts. Love that they compost too - was fun to contribute our coffee grounds and veggie scraps to the pile.

72833,888577,1/29/2012,Vanessa,"This property truly is an excellent value.

First off location is convenient to many points. My boyfriend and I were both in town for work in SW Austin but wanted to maximize our opportunity to see friends who work and live north. It provided a great home base to both head to the office in the morning and to see friends in the evening. Easy 10 minute or less drives to Monkey Nest Coffee Korea House off Anderson and of course was walking distance to Kerbey and Russell's Bakery/Cafe.

About the property itself the private driveway parking  just outside the cottage windows meant it was easy to run back and forth to load/unload. The stocked full-size fridge in the well-equipped kitchen let us enjoy real breakfasts in the room in the morning and bring home leftovers at night. Wifi was strong and we had multiple machines/devices connected with no issues. While this is definitely an older mother-in-law cottage it was immaculately clean on our arrival - and I mean down to the baseboards - which I appreciated since I'm a bit of a neat freak. Since we stayed a week we took advantage of the washer/dryer in the garage next door to do laundry on day 5 which was also a plus.

As others have mentioned the only possible dings are the size of the shower the comfort of the bed and the A/C/Heater unit. (Details below.) Even with these elements taken into consideration the property really is a great value and I would definitely return on my own. Andy was an excellent host greeting us a few times but never intrusive. I left behind a small makeup mirror and he was kind enough to mail it home to me after I contacted him about it.

These details are just in the interest of helping others make an informed decision. As I said I would stay again in a heartbeat.

The shower is small older and a bit dark. My boyfriend is just over 6ft and while he could fit in the shower space fine he had to bend to rinse his hair as the shower head hit below the top of his head. There was however plenty of hot water at all times.

The bed is a futon that is laid flat when you arrive. The listing does state this but I'm afraid I overlooked it. We made it through our first few nights comfortably but the stiffness was more noticeable toward the end of our week especially for my boyfriend who prefers a soft mattress.

Lastly setting the wall unit on low does reduce the noise - and it's white noise the whole time no rattling or power-up clunks - but it is definitely noticeable. We would turn it off to sleep and then wake up a few times to turn it on and off to regulate the temperature. (Note: it was actually kind of nice for me because despite being a light sleeper myself it actually drowned out the noise of the snoring boyfriend.)",Central Cottage with bikes!,378744,Andy & Ellen

We appreciated her detailed info about the house -- what to do what not to do where everything is -- and also the extra info about the neighborhood and the city.  The beds and pillows were very comfy.  The kitchen was fantastic.  The bathroom and shower were wonderful.  We felt very comfortable in this bungalow.  There was plenty of space for three adults and one toddler.  

Yes there is a train VERY close by.  But Susan deserves a lot of credit for being up front about the train; I greatly appreciated NOT being surprised upon hearing the train whistle.

So even though you can go shopping and eat at several great places you feel like you are in a remote forest when you go back to the Loft! 

The Loft is bright and lovely. The decor is minimalist clean and fresh. Windows surround the Loft from all sides bringing in great light throughout the day!

If you are a nature lover you will love all of the close trails around the Loft. There are trails that you can walk to through from the Loft or take a short drive (5 min) to city-provided trails. 

If you love history be sure to ask Bill about the history of Austin and the trails and all sorts of other things. He is SO knowledgeable about everything!

After initially being rejected last minute by another AirBNB location we found this place. It was actually a very good thing as Dallas' place was far superior.

Five of us came down to Austin for SXSW and we all fit comfortably (2 couples and a single). The house was clean spacious and came pre-stocked with a 24 pack of Lone Star. We run the social beer network Untappd so we appreciated this perk! There we no complaints about the beds (I know the one I slept on was extremely comfortable). Did I mention that the place was spacious? It's a modern townhouse with very comfortable couches. The artwork hung throughout is also very very awesome - wanted to take a couple home! 

The neighborhood is very quiet. It's about a 5 minute drive from down town or a 15-20 minute bus ride (which one of our guys did several times with no trouble). It was good to be able to get away from the madness of downtown during SXSW and relax.

The place was huge (compared to our NYC apartments especially) and had beautiful high ceilings with lots of sunlight flooding in. The amenities were modern the bedrooms and bathrooms were immaculately cleaned and the backyard and porch provided an excellent quiet spot to sip a coffee before heading into the crowded masses of SXSW downtown.

281182,1002169,3/15/2012,Lydia,"Four members of our team recently stayed here during SXSW Interactive. We loved the house and the landlord's hospitality! There are 3 well sized bedrooms and the landlord made sure that we had clean sheets towels and toiletries (shampoo soap) available. We also had a fourth that used the couch which he said was very comfortable. The kitchen is gorgeous and if you had the opportunity to cook it would be an ideal space for 4-5 people to have dinner. Overall the landlord was very conscientious. Not only did she make sure we had the few toiletries you would expect in a hotel but she stocked the fridge with staples such as bread milk oj and peanut butter. Since we were constantly on the move this extra effort was much appreciated. However even if she hadn't there was a small corner grocery less than a block away to pick up simple must haves. 

The neighborhood is a little strange. It is obvious that it is ""coming back."" The few houses surrounding ours were very nice! But there were portions of the block further down that looked a little sketchy. I feel like this will change overtime as the neighborhood continues to grow. One great example (and thanks again to the landlord for her forethought and help here) was the easy access to the metro! It is a gorgeous new train about 3 blocks away from the house (and the landlord provided us with a schedule). The only annoyance was that it did not run on Sundays which proved problematic since cabs were unwilling to come pick us up during the peak SXSW times. If you are visiting at any other time period this wouldn't be an issue.

He was very responsive and accommodating to any question/concern/ or request I might have had.  I was in Austin for SXSW which can be chaotic and stressful (if you've ever played or booked a show during the festival you know exactly what I'm talking about) and the one thing I did not have to stress or worry about was my accommodations.  Although Marcus was traveling during my recent visit - he made sure that I was well taken care of by his family.  This place really is the epitome of what AirBnB is about - great people helping travelers without the burden of insane hotel prices.

330301,1008102,3/17/2012,Merlin,"I think Janet was the ultimate hostess. She was super nice and accommodating! On the very first day she offered to pick me up from the conference center upon registering for South By Interactive. 

We went out for dinner and met some of her friends. Later we went to a swanky bar in Austin which I thought was very cool. The house itself was very nice comfortable space spacious high ceilings and well kept place. I had the entire upstairs of the house to myself. Which included a large bedroom comfortable queen bed private full bath living room and meditation/entertainment room! Really who could ask for more. I also had access to a large kitchen main living room and washer/dryer on the main floor. Even though I spent most of my time at the conference it was nice to be staying in such a beautiful home and feel very welcomed. I felt very fortunate to come across such a great place right before the event with an really an awesome host. The only downside is that the metro which takes you into downtown Austin is a little further then I expected and the prices for taxis are bit high for South By which I was not aware of. Yet Janet was very accommodating with rides to the bus back to the house and to the Apple store when I had to replace my stolen cell phone. So I would recommend a rental in the future which I wanted to avoid to not have to deal with parking and save a little.     

Overall an awesome first Airbnb experience! The house was beautiful spacious and very comfortable. Janet made me feel very welcomed is super nice accommodating and easy to reach if needed.

The bathrooms are very big which made getting ready simple even for 6 women :)  The location is also great- 2 blocks to South Congress which is a great part of Austin.  We typically walked downtown during the day (takes about 20-30 min but with plenty of restaurants bars and shops on the way) and took cabs back at night.  It was very convenient and it was always a pleasure to come back to this quiet house after the longs days of SXSW.

Joe was also wonderful.  He stopped by to introduce himself and was very pleasant.  He was very easy to contact and any questions we had were promptly answered with a text.

It is a mile from the convention center so if you are not used to walking know you can rent bikes or take pedicabs/rickshaws as they are more accessible than cabs late at night.

Her apartment is really beautiful and clean and is in a safe neighbourhood within walking distance of all the coolest bars. I will note that it could take an hour to walk across the river but for us that only added to the fun - it's was amazing what we found along the way! Cath has a cleaner come in before all guests so the place was spotless and the beds were all really roomy and so comfortable. 

Our group was there for SXSW so with 6 girls getting ready each morning the two huge bathrooms were a treat! Unfortunately (or not!) we spent most of each day checking out bands for the festival so we didn't get a chance to use the pool but we did have breakfast there in the mornings and it was a really peaceful place to sit and relax. I can also recommend the nearby ""La Boite"" cafe for the best croissants! 

One particular highlight of Cath's apartment - getting out of our car after 6 days on the road to find that she had left us cold beers wine and cheese! Now that is the perfect host! Thank you so much to her for that and we apologise that we partied too hard to have the time to replace it all! 

All in all I really cannot fault Cath or her apartment and I have to say that some of us have already planned our trip back to SXSW next year! Hopefully she will be hosting again....

The apartment was really clean comfortable and extremely private. It easily accommodated the three of us my girlfriend and I upstairs and our friend on the futon. On the whole the experience was pleasant and one I'd gladly engage in again!

The place is perfectly located on 6th street - away from the mayhem but walking distance to it.  There's a lot of great food places nearby including this taco ruck right opposite.  She had also left towels behind and a detailed list of where to eat / things to do.  In short really the perfect host. 

The only flip side for us was that 7 of us rented her place and while 4 people slept in the 2 lovely bedrooms the other 3 were relegated to the garage converted to a bedroom.  The beds are nice and the garage is super spacious but there's no curtain there so it makes it hard to sleep in.  The place is really ideal for 4 people.

While we were there the water heater malfunctioned so we had no hot water at first but Joe took care of it promptly and was polite and apologetic.

Sovay's helper Santiago was very nice and very helpful as well. I am kinda a clean freak but was super surprised and delighted on how clean and well maintained the cottage's condition. The kitchen is well stocked and she even has a few extras like soap bandages mouthwash and things of that nature.

This place is relatively close to downtown and it is easy to get to the major highways. If you don't want the hassle of parking downtown no problem the buses run right outside the door and a cab ride would not be too expensive. It is also a mile or so to the hip area of south congress not a bad walk. 

We highly recommend Sovay's cottage on south first. We would totally stay here again though I do want to check out her other place as well! 

We hope you enjoy your stay in Austin. I am from Austin and miss it terribly. We hope to be moving back in a year or so.

Sevylla does a great job of describing and depicting her place here on the website--it was bright beautiful colorful and very comfortable. She was super helpful with directions and suggested some great ways to get to know Austin. I rented her scooter and had a blast riding into town on it too. I appreciated staying in a neighborhood versus in the middle of bustling downtown: it was very quiet and peaceful so I could come home in the late afternoon and relax in her really cool yard and her neighbors are nice and welcoming as well. Whether we were hanging out together or just text messaging our communication was smooth all week and Sevylla was not just really easy to get along with but also an inspiring person to learn from.

The queen bed was very comfy and the air conditioner unit worked great. It has a small kitchen with: fridge microwave and a full stove if you want to cook (we didn't). The only thing we did miss having was a TV but it does have WiFi. If you're looking for a comfortable clean place to stay this was great. 
It is located off of South Congress street in a residential very walkable neighborhood close to many restaurants and vintage shops. There is a small ""Farm to Grocery"" food store a couple of blocks away where you can get groceries wine toiletries etc.

Downstairs is a couch that can double as a bed and a bathroom with shower.  It has a closet  table and fridge all of which are small but adequate.  The downstairs has a separate air conditioner as well as a ceiling fan. The place is not luxurious but has a certain charm.  It is fine for 2-3 travelers and is a real value.

To being with Scott was great to correspond with.  He was always prompt and very helpful.  We arrived at the house without problems and it was very clean and more beautiful than the pictures.  They had graciously left a bottle of champagne to welcome us.

The house is very large and could comfortably sleep 10 people without using the air mattresses.  The common spaces and the outside patio are amazing for large groups as there is plenty of seating and it has a very warm and open feel.  The living room is well laid out and the kitchen is very modern and well-stocked for all of your cooking needs.  The outside areas felt quite private as they are on a corner lot and their lawn is very large.  It was perfect for enjoying a late spring evening.  Location was also ideal being very close to Barton Springs and downtown.  We opted to drive everywhere but you could easily bike to many locations.  We took a taxi to downtown and it was $12 (very affordable in my opinion). The neighborhood is really adorable (watch out for the ""Otter Crossing: Drive Slow!"" handmade signs around) and very safe.

Definitely a great place to stay and an amazing deal!  I looked for days on every rental website and was so relieved to find this house.  The only thing to be aware of is that this is their house not a vacation rental home.  Therefore there will be clothes in the closet food in the fridge etc.  However it was immaculate and there was plenty of room for all of our stuff so it's really not a con at all.

The area is definitely ""up and coming"" and changes block by block -- but the location of this property is on a very quiet quaint street that felt very safe. 

The only thing that was a little weird about the property was that the bathroom doesn't have a door -- just a curtain -- and it's right next to the bed. I noticed that you can see this from the photos Fiona posted but I just wanted to point it out as I didn't pick up on it before we checked in.

78831,1201913,4/30/2012,Gavin,"I don't know what more I can add to the other positive reviews but I'll take a stab starting with the location and accomodations:

The guest apartment is comfy private and clean with the ammenities that most people on a vacation would need: coffee maker (with coffee supplied by Marcus) wifi large shower/bath and a fridge and microwave to preserve and reheat the leftovers.  Having lived in Austin part of my decision process in choosing to stay here was based on the location.  For those not from Austin Hyde Park is a charming older neighborhood (designated historic district) with a sampling of turn of the century houses and 1920s bungalows.  Basically for first time visitors wanting to get more of a feel for the city the accomodations and neighborhood come highly recommended.  Also for those who have a rental car there's ample on street parking so finding a space to park on the same block is a non-issue 

In relation to the host Marcus was on top of things and ensuring we knew how to reach his place by emailing clear instructions (including google map pictures) the day before we left for the trip.  Our plane came in at a later hour so he made sure everything was laid out so that we could get access to the accomodations beforehand.  Unfortunately our paths didn't cross while I was there as I was often off and doing things but Marcus checked in to make sure everything with the accomodations were good and that we didn't need anything without being overbearing.  I have no doubts that had their been any issues or if I were a guest that wanted a suggestion on things to see or do he would have been quick to resolve any issues or offer up a local's advice.  In addition the coffee in the mornings and the complimentary array of Shiner in the fridge was enjoyed.  We were even treated to two small personal pies as his friend is in the business.

In summary the accomodations were great and Marcus was an exceptional host.  Both Will and I had a great time and at the end of the day enjoyed the compli",Cool Hyde Park efficiency apartment,423840,Marcus

120230,1210975,5/1/2012,April,"Lisa's super cute condo was a great way to experience Austin like a local.  It's close enough to downtown and the trendy SoCo district to be driveable (about 5-10 minutes) but it's located in a quiet neighborhood that's set back from the main drag. Because the condo sits right across the street from an elementary school I was a little leery about playground noise but turns out I never heard any children unless I was walking outside to our rental car!  I was pleasantly surprised.

I loved Lisa's decorating style (the individual bottles of sand collected from her travels around the world are so sweet!) and the giant bed is incredibly comfy.  The girl also has a picture on the wall of her and Willie Nelson.  That is too cool!  We spent most of our time outside of the condo so we never really had any need to watch television.  (If you're spending your time indoors watching cable TV in this awesome town you're doing something wrong.)  We had requested an air mattress for our stay but Lisa called to tell me that she recommended sleeping on her living room couch instead.  She's totally right the couch was waaaaayyy better.  If you're too good to wrap up on a couch you might not like this arrangement but I was pretty comfortable sleeping here when I wasn't in the bed.

Aside from that Lisa is an awesome host--she left us an incredibly detailed packet with things to eat see and do while we were in town.  I sorta wish we hadn't brought a rental car because I really wanted to call her friend Carlos for a taxi ride!  I mean how often do someone give you a personal taxi cab recommendation?

72318,1211230,5/1/2012,Elionora,Lotus House is AMAZING the location is breathtaking all by itself but once you enter the actual inside it honestly feels like home. The photos do not give this place the justice it deserves. It's full of beautiful light positive energy and the littlest details throughout every corner remind you how close you really are to earth. My partner and I unfortunately did not meet Alyson on our trip although she did contact us kept in touch and was extremely helpful prior to us arriving. When we were checking in her friend was patient and welcoming on our brief meet; we settled in without any problem. It was quiet and peaceful here one of those places that make you want to stay in just to enjoy the beauty around you. The patio has doors from the bedroom and the bathroom gives you the most simple view trees and more trees (who doesn't want to see that after waking up or stepping out of a shower? Which by the way they have great water pressure!). The sun room gives you an overlook of warm open Austin with comfy couches to relax in and goodness we wished we had more time to enjoy everything this place has to offer. If we could live here we really would. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Austin and wanting to stay somewhere clean spacious genuine and absolutely lovely. We would not hesitate on coming here again and booking Lotus House. Thank you again Alyson!,Kingsize Bedroom w Balcony!,374529,Max

They were helpful & more then happy to share their local knowledge of the city from outdoor activities bars & the best food in town. 

Just on our first night the guys picked us up from the train station & we joined them for dinner at the best burger place in town. Later that night we all stole away on mopeds to play midnight putt putt on the local golf course.

The house itself is cool clean and roomy. There were 3 of us staying and we had one room and a ridiculously comfy couch. I know these guys also rent out the whole house which would also be fun if we came back with more friends (soon!).

The guys also let us borrow their bikes while we were there for the 10-15min ride into town to explore. The bus system is also great and close by if you don't have a car. 

If your looking for a clean friendly fun place to stay this is it. I would highly recommended staying here especially if you've never been to Austin as their local knowledge is invaluable and there is nothing better then a beautiful home and gracious hosts.

She had helpful hints and instructions posted on the fridge door. The bathroom was spotless and stocked with Moroccan oil shampoo Bath & Body works toiletries and plenty of towels. The bedroom: the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in. It was that good. I like that Sovay thinks about the little things you may need - from alarm clock to extra toothbrushes blow dryer iron etc. We didn't get to meet her but from these little details we can sense that we were taken care of!
And lastly the location: you will fall in love with Austin just by staying in this neigborhood: Zilker. the Alamo Drafthouse is just a few walks away (we watched Avengers and thought it was the best movie expericence we had) Chuy's Austin Java and Flipnotics Coffee House is just around the corner; Thom's Market is a charming little local grocer for your produce and alcohol needs and behind that is Flip Happy Crepes where they serve the best crepes in all Austin!

Fully and thoughtfully equipped kitchen with things like a razor sharp serrated bread knife for the yummy loaf I got to go with the Antonelli's cheese shop picnic (a couple miles away on Duval St.) that we enjoyed on the bungalow's quiet side patio.
But we could have picked the rooftop terrace she's built instead!
There is a Washer/Dryer. And bikes free to use. Good conversation to be had with Edie and Alberto if you like. A profusion of wild sunflowers in the alley behind that you can pick and bring home for a souvenir.

Having such a comfortable fully furnished house with excellent hospitality from Joseph made our move to Austin so much easier. Our needs as a relocating family probably differ from vacationers but Joseph was so accommodating I'm sure that whatever you need to make your stay more comfortable will be provided. The location of the house is excellent. Very convenient to all the major highways and a straight shot down 1st St to downtown. The house has a large backyard too which can't be said for many Austin homes. There are plenty of ways to entertain yourself inside too with a PS3 TV movies etc. Great house great location great hospitality! ,Stylish 3/2/2 with large backyard,1282837,Joseph

70659,1295502,5/17/2012,Dorothy,"This lovely cottage worked out perfectly for my daughter and me.  We spent 3 nights there and couldn't have been happier.  Sara was nice enough to leave coffee tea and milk for us so we were able to get our morning ""fix"" without leaving the cottage.  We also found some travel-size shampoo in the shower which we really appreciated. 

The cottage is a perfect size we didn't feel cramped at all and has a recently-done beautiful bathroom.  It has a desk where one can work (which I did) as well as a good internet connection microwave and coffee maker.

We rented a car while in Austin but within walking distance of the cottage there is a major supermarket and a funky ""Austin-like"" cafe called Cherrywood Coffeehouse where we had fun checking out the local scene... there is another place not too far (maybe 20 minutes walking) that has southern food called Hoovers Cooking on Manor Rd.

Although we didn't meet Sara personally she left the key for us at an agreed-upon spot and our ""check out"" consisted of leaving the key where we found it.  It was great to be able to ""check in"" at midnight without bothering our host.  She also let us know ahead of time that the door to the cottage has a ""personality"" and that we would have to give it a little push or pull to make it open and close properly - but it wasn't a problem we figured it out easily and appreciated being forewarned...

All in all a great stay and we would stay there again!  Thanks Sara!

69810,1333835,5/23/2012,Claire,Our stay at the Birdhouse was perfect from the get-go.  Communication by text and email with Dolina was prompt and courteous and she and her husband Yohan are warm and welcoming hosts.   The Birdhouse itself is just as charming and adorable as in the photos--if not more so!  Dolina is an interior designer and it shows- with the fun colors design details and ingenious use of space.  The house is cozy yet airy trendy yet 'homey'... and very practical with the kitchen nook and sleeping loft in addition to the main quarters.  The two closets were well lit and large with lots of hangers and an iron and ironing board.  The beds were cozy!  Lovely fresh organic white linens to cuddle up in... And the towels in the well-stocked bathroom were thick and fuzzy.  The casita is tucked away from the road in a beautiful rear garden and very tranquil.  The patio was a delight to emerge onto in the cool morning to sit amidst he bamboo and live oaks and have a cup of coffee... SUCH a treat.  There is even a second patio behind the casita but we loved the first one so much that we didn't feel the need to use it.  All in all this was a wonderful experience that we would highly recommend to anyone seeking a unique experience in Austin.  A+++,Cozy Casita Near Downtown in SoCo,82762,Dolina

Matt's place is conveniently located in trendy SoCo area with private entrance that backs on close to main road (yet still very quiet) and is close to some great restaurants cafes and boutique stores.

It costs approx. $28-30 to take a cab from the airport. Although area is close to Downtown ($10 cab ride) you need a car in Austin to get around effortlessly and to see the sights.

Matt was kind enough to let us use his washing machine and dryer inside the main house.

The amenities in the granny flat were adequate for the cost and the fact that it's not a hotel (note no iron toaster blow dryer or many kitchen utensils). There is no to minimum natural light but it's clean with no clutter at all (i.e. no personal belongings) so easy to settle into.

The bed is ultra comfortable with fluffy pillows and a super fluffy quilt.

The place has A/C and in Austin you need it! Matt was thoughtful so turned it on so the flat was cool when we got in. He also left nice new small shampoo bottles and soap in the shower for us to use.

Also I loved the super-detailed instructions/tips page they leave in the house.

We ended up using all of his suggestions for places to go and see eat and play.

We went down to Austin just to hang out and spend some time away from our busy schedules and this was a true delight.  We were able to go to the Wheatsville CoOp grocery pick up some great food and snacks.  Sara had beer and some other great refreshments in the trailer already.  The shower was fantastic the bed was very comfortable and the space was a great blend of vintage and modern.  The YARD! was an oasis!  and did not feel like you were in their back yard we enjoyed dinner and cocktails on the patio.  The aux. jack in the trailer so we could listen to our own music was another bonus.  It was warm the weekend we were there and the AC was perfect!

The backyard was peaceful with lots of fun things to enjoy from nature to painted walls to wind chimes. My kids enjoyed playing with one of Lois' cats that was living in the backyard. Everywhere you look there's something cool and artsy to see. 

The space is very welcoming and comfortable. We like the option of the loft although all four of us ended up sleeping on the futons and pillows downstairs. The bathroom is small and the shower is really tight but it was nice to have access to a bathroom and not have to bother them in the main house like some places. 

When I booked for some reason I miscalculated the days and booked one day short. Lois was very understanding and was able to accommodate us for an extra day. We were truly grateful!

We wanted to explore the SoCo art and food district from close-by digs. We only live about :35 away but it was nice having a ""home"" only :05 away from where we wanted to be.

The original plan was to go to Hamilton Pool the first morning of our stay but a mishap on the way precluded us from that plan. Nonetheless we thoroughly enjoyed the view of St. Edwards and the idyllic little tree-lined neighborhood. It was safe beautiful and convenient to where we wanted to be.

The pantry and fridge were stocked but there was still room for us to add our own groceries and leftovers from our foodie excursions. The closet full of games and artists supplies also afforded us some memory-making downtime when we weren't exploring. The beds were comfortable the shower great the dishes ample the space well-decorated and the world map a dinner time conversation piece. We felt so at home!

If you stay at Brooks' place we highly recommend breakfast at Gourdough's and Izzozz Tacos then a perusal of Lovely across the street.

But driving through the neighborhood and the trees up the windy driveway our focus changed from the 6 hours of flights and traveling we'd just gone through to the beauty of West Hills Austin. The house was beyond our expectations it wasn't just a rental house but a home with books and toys spices in the pantry and a lived in feeling that made our vacation as relaxing as it could have been. The deck provided endless hours of enjoyment as we relaxed with our coach and enjoyed the warmth of Austin. The huge  dining room let us have meals together as a team though we did enjoy a few meals out seeing as we were a little under 15min from down town. Everyone had a nice bed a warm shower and a great time staying at the House on the Creek!

Lois was a fabulous hostess and very helpful when we needed her (thanks for the jump to our car!) and friendly.  I would stay here again in a second - and hopefully I will have the opportunity.

Not sure my husband could hack it though.  The beds are futon matresses on the floor (which I found quite comfortable and slept like a baby; he might have trouble getting up and down with his artificial hip) and the shower is close quarters (he's a big guy; so what if I didn't shave my legs while I was here - it's Austin for goodness sakes!).  No coffee pot which was rough the first day but I survived my caffiene-free experiment.

First I want to say that this was my first Airbnb experience so Joe had to do a lot of hand-holding to help me get verified and explain policies.  He was so friendly and patient always.  Things went very smoothly.

I love the SoCo cottage.  The place is spotless and so well thought out.  They used the softest bedding and towels and nice granite and tiles so it feels fancier that I would have ever expected for the price.  The location is just right too.  Not too far from the cool part of SoCo (but far enough so you don't need to deal with traffic). The bar down the street is worth a visit too.  When I had a minor issue Joe's wife was beyond accommodating!  

The place isn't quite as cute from the outside as it is inside.... but once you are inside you are wrapped up in all of it's goodness you will be happy and comfortable.

The weather in Austin was hotttt so we really appreciated the A/C and being able to store drinks in the refrigerator. Most of all we appreciated the close proximity to Barton Springs and Deep Eddy. 

We loved the neighborhood and the peacefulness of Zilker Park. The parking was easy and being near the stores and a vegetarian restaurant like Mr. Natural was perfect! We rented a car from the airport lot (best deal we found was on Hotwire) and it allowed us to travel all over Austin. Public transit can be a bit slow and with the heat biking can get really sweaty.

259845,1578969,6/28/2012,Delfin,"Tuve la suerte de encontrar en Linda Crockett para una estadía de tres meses en Austin una persona encantadora cálida amable y servicial como era de esperarse de una puertorriqueña nata. Desde un primer momento me sentí en una situación familiar y las prestaciones de la casa cuarto sala baño y cocina son inmejorables (sólo el piano necesita una afinación...). Linda también es una excelente guía y fuente de información para conocer Austin y disfrutar su oferta cultural (es directiva del Mexican American Cultural Center importante institución de la comunidad latina que ostenta uno de los edificios de mejor arquitectura en la ciudad).

Poseer un auto en Austin y Texas parece ser la norma y aunque la casa está servida por varias líneas de autobuses conviene informarse de antemano de los horarios si no se quiere esperar indefinidamente su paso. En autobús se está en la Universidad de Texas en unos 15 minutos y en el centro en menos tiempo aún. Un punto a tener en cuenta sin necesidad de alarmarse ni obsesionarse por él sino simplemente tomar las debidas precauciones es que la casa está a dos cuadras y media de una esquina ""caliente"" (12th St. & Chicon). Aunque hay evidente tráfico de drogas en este punto la convivencia y el tránsito por él suelen ser pacíficos. También es fácil evitar esta esquina utilizando otras paradas de autobuses que están a igual o menor distancia de la casa.

La bicicleta es otra opción de transporte si bien Austin no es una ciudad totalmente plana y hay que estar en muy buena forma para pedalear por algunas de sus empinadas calles.

En general mi recomendación para una estadía con Linda en el histórico Austin East Side es absoluta. Estén preparados para un sincero abrazo de bienvenida de esta inmejorable anfitriona.

On arrival there was beer in the fridge a nice fruit platter and two welcoming dogs. The backyard and patio is great for hanging out with friends- lots of shade and the AC will cool the place down in no time. The neighborhood is quiet with plenty of street parking.

He was an incredibly responsive host and answered all questions I had usually within an hour or less. 

The cottage was very clean and cool when we arrived very late in the evening. We had no issues getting in despite rolling into town at about 11 p.m. We were pleased to find that Joe had left a nice hand-written note and a bottle of wine 

We did have an issue connecting to the wireless internet which was quickly solved by rebooting the wireless router -- thanks to Joe's wife to helping us fix that quickly. Worked flawlessly afterward for the rest of our trip. 

The location is great -- easy to find; great access to downtown without all the noise. We spent an evening at the Crow Bar -- an establishment just a short walk up the street. They have an amazing juke box and delicious mixed drinks. Totally worth your time. 

In all we had a great experience at the Cottage. It was just what we needed -- comfortable clean easy to access and private. I'd certainly stay here again if and when we return to Austin. Can't beat a place this nice for the price.

We loved how this place was very secluded yet close in vacinity to Austin's urban eclectic areas.  My husband and I thought Jim was a very cool and laid back host.  He stocked our fridge with awesome little snacks that we were delightfully thankful for after our hikes and tours through SoCo.  There is an outdoor shower for the venturesome type.  Yes we were venturesome and it was too neat to bathe outdoors.  Haha obviously we live the city.  :D  One of the coolest parts was that Jim has the cutest little goats!  Yes I said goats.  They are adorable.  Unfortunately my husband and I had to leave a day early in a bit of a hurry because our pet sitter was not able to look after our pet but we would have loved to stay longer if we could have.

While trying to decided between trying to talk the insurance company into extending my hospital stay (unlikely) and checking into a cheap motel I ran across the ad for Earlynn's studio.

I cannot say enough about how perfect my stay was.  Earlynn did everything she could to make sure I was comfortable including giving me the quiet time I needed to recover.  Everything in the studio is right there at your fingertips and the simple elegance of the interior is comforting. 

Several of my visitors commented on the great location and all agreed it would be as perfect for an adult weekend away from the kids as it was for convalescing after surgery.

The decor is modern and cozy the bed super cozy and the shower has great water pressure. We truly felt like we were staying at The Saint Cecilia (our favorite ""hotel"" in town) because it's such a stylish and comfortable suite.

Dolina was so sweet to ask what we like to drink in the morning and provided fresh ground coffee a french press and milk!  Along with ripe fruit which truly started my day off right.  She went above and beyond!

As I said her casita is in a great neighborhood near cafes and food carts we love and it's a quick drive to South Congress and Downtown.  For my favorite spots in Austin see my city guide:  (website hidden)

The only thing I would suggest is to bring your own bottled water as the tap water is not drinkable in my opinion.

279476,1651766,7/7/2012,Donna,to please and help in any way.  I should also mention that this is a great location and a great price for a place so covenient in Austin.  From the outside you will wonder where you have arrived.  On this inside however you will find a series of rooms in a quad layout around a central area that houses the office and kitchen.  The whole place is spotlessly clean!  What I personally failed to understand from the listing is that the room shown does NOT have an ensuite bathroom.  There is shared bathroom space in the hall.  Of course sharing is only necessary if there are other guests.  To accommodate me Andrea offered me the only room that has a private bath area (shower/toilet in room).  That was really nice of her and would have been perfect except that the hot water tank had not been installed properly so there was no hot water.  I presume that this problem will have been fixed by now but I would have been remiss to not mention it.  I must also say that the air-conditioning is a little spotty depending on which room you are assigned.  Mine was uncomfortably warm (I was told later that Andrea would have fixed that for me!) but every room does have an oscillating fan which helps.  All in all I think I would return if I needed another budget stay for a short time.  Thanks Andrea!~,Austin Zen Stay / Home Office 12,1427814,Andrea

Would my friends and I be better off paying more and getting a hotel than renting a place to stay through the site? Should we really take a risk?

Well I'm *really* happy that we did. The place was everything we expected and more. It's just as charming as it looks and the feel to the entire place was warm comforting and inviting. Every night after a long day tubing or adventuring we happily looked forward to going back ""home"" to our cottage. And whenever we just wanted to sit back and chat it was great to have the *beautiful* patio right outside to sit at. The feel to the place fit exactly what we were all looking for that weekend: soothing refreshing and just plain great!

For those wondering too you CAN'T beat the location. EVERYTHING we wanted to do was a short 10 minute drive away. It was great too knowing we could always park in front of the house in a safe neighborhood for free. Got a little tired of paying for parking in downtown Austin.

And although we didn't really get to meet Sara we did meet Travis and a few of their family friends who were all great. Additionally I loved that Sara was so willing to work with us! Even though the place only technically accommodates 2 she allowed our party of four to spend 3 nights. We were able to fit a queen size inflatable bed between the bed and the door at night which we just deflated in the morning. Worked like a charm. While we could have certainly gotten a double room at a hotel to ""fix"" that problem none of us would have in retrospect. You just can't beat the place that Sara and Travis have created.

It was also in a great location; getting to downtown by car took no more than 5 minutes and was right in the middle of everything to do in Austin. I cannot stress how awesome our stay here was.

We were able to either walk or drive to so many parks restaurants etc......even a public library within a block.  The home itself was perfectly equipped right down to the impeccably clean bed linens and plush fresh towels.  This home has it all and the energy you need.  Plentiful amounts of natural light during the day and the ability to  block it out when the sun goes down.  Beautiful porch off the master bedroom that will leave wanting the sun to go down.....great skyline views to boot!  There is a grocery store within a mile and a great little convienance store within 2 blocks. The hosts of this home were very professional and easy to work with.  Can't wait for our next visit!

As if Austin needs *another* selling point! Fiona's place - and all her helpfulness - are yet more highlights of this awesome town.

If you want a launch site to 6th Street's attractions and surrounds (both the major neon ones closer to the city and the uber hipster joints further east) this is a great place to stay. We easily walked to all the music food and atmosphere we felt like taking in. And it was pretty easy to work out public transport options too (the excellent wifi will help you plan everything too!).

Fiona is a great host and a fine ambassador for the neighborhood (which we would happily have wandered around even more for the State Cemetery French Legation groovy bars good food and generally chilled out vibe). So if you want to hang out amongst all the action OR do the complete opposite and retreat from the world this place will work for you.

Brandon and his wife made our stay comfortable and easy to navigate there was plenty of space for kids and dog and three adults who were so harried when we arrived that we pitched the kids out the door and took long naps on luxurious beds. The kids ran wild and enjoyed the neighborhood which is only partially developed. I took my dog on long walks every morning through the same empty lots which function as a green belt -- an unexpected bonus.

The house is light-filled and airy the architecture is fun -- I couldn't have asked for a better vacation home. Concrete floors roomy showers a generous dining room and kitchen -- the lower level is open-plan and set up perfectly for entertaining. Each bedroom has its own bathroom.

So great to have a pool and a fitness suite on site with a better selection of equipment than you find in most hotels.  Chris is a wonderful host and can't do enough to make your stay a comfortable one - even going out of his way to lend us his bikes.  Spotlessly clean and spacious.  High speed internet makes working there very easy.  The beds in the rooms are really comfortable offering a great night's sleep but it took a couple of nights to get used to the road noise.  It was all worth it though for the great positioning in Austin with easy walking access to 6th Street's bars restaurants and coffee shops.  The apartment is also really well located for downtown the main highway and the airport. Secure parking meant we could relax and leave stuff in the car overnight.  All in all a great stay.

Marcus was a fantastic host offering us suggestions recommendations and great spots to check out in Austin as it was our very first time in such a great city. I am glad we stayed in an apartment that was just as interesting as Austin. There was just not enough time to check everything out!  

Marcus made sure to make himself available if we needed anything at all. We spent a total of two nights in the apartment and it offered everything we needed at a price that fit our budget. Marcus was very flexible with arrival and departure times as our schedule changed a bit. The neighborhood was quiet and inviting with most popular destinations just a few minutes away. 

The fort was AWESOME. Whoever built it was a creative genius - if you stay here I highly recommend you check it out. 

For those of you that are browsing and thinking of staying here - my only comment is to make sure you know that the bed is a futon; I am not picky at all but others might be.

Setting up dates and arrival/departure times were a breeze and both Susan and her husband were a pleasure to work with. The apartment was a wonderful comfortable and welcoming space. The linens were top notch the bed very comfortable and the air conditioning quite cool.

The airbed is pretty comfortable almost as good as a real bed and I used the desk and chair a lot while I was there.  Little touches like fresh packaged soap in the bathroom when you get in and fresh towels really make you feel like you're taken care of.  I ended up staying for a couple extra weeks and everything went smoothly great to have a private entrance so I could just pop in and out whenever I wanted.  There are labels all over the kitchen and bathroom so it's easy to find things and not have to ask a bunch of questions when you first get in.

Upon check-in my mom and I found the place to be spotless & smelling heavenly. Drew let us in on his wife's secret: mint oil mixed with water in a spray bottle -- genius! We found the studio to be exactly as the photos portray it: airy roomy & modern yet cozy. Drew was very friendly and approachable & showed us how to use Netflix and Pandora for the television which were both much appreciated features of this accommodation. He also was generous with my parents on their check-out day offering them some extra time unprompted which they definitely needed.

I'm a resident of this neighborhood so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this area can't be beat!

I loved having a full kitchen and a washer and dryer.  The bed and bedding were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and had lots of drawer space. 

Check-in was really easy; Angele left a key in the lockbox and called later to make sure everything was okay.  I never met her but she was the perfect ""host"" in that she made sure that I had everything that I needed. She even brought me a large soup pot when I told her I had a hankering to make some soup. What a sweetheart!

Note that when you arrive the condo is at the southeast corner of 9th and Highland even though the street sign says that Highland is the 1400 block.  Just tell the cabbie ""corner of 9th and Highland"" and save arguing with him about the address; if you give him the address he'll try to take you to the corner of 9th and West Lynn which is not correct.

Parking was easy lots of places close by to eat and visit. Burned off all the calories from the Ice Cream Festival by walking to and from Fiesta Gardens :). We didn't go downtown much but I could see this being a good place to sleep if you plan to drink and not drive. 

A few small cons including the cute but a small clawfoot tub (I'm only 5'4"" and I felt a little cramped.) and the fact that things could have been a little cleaner/fresher (crumbs/dirt on the floor and musty towels). Also you might want to bring a sleeping mask if you are sensitive to light -- I sleep like a rock but my friend had a hard time with all the ambient light from the windows + light curtains.

You can chill in the front or the back yard or take walks in the neighborhood. If you need to cook she has all the cupboards marked for you convenience. She has filtered water which is great.

Peggy is busy writing her book about Afghan women and she started the ""Afghan Women's Project"". This is a very interesting woman with a deeply spiritual and welcoming soul. She epitomizes what is best of old Austin and if you're cool and open you'll truly enjoy your stay whether you talk with her or you just chill in your room.

Everything was so clean and cozy. My friends had never been to Austin but we found ourselves not leaving the bungalow until late in the morning because we were so comfortable relaxing inside or enjoying the garden.  It's conveniently seconds away to all the restaurants and nightlife on the east side yet the bungalow has such a calm and serene feel to it that you feel like your miles away in the middle of nature. Quite the perfect Austin balance! The four bikes that they provide were absolutely perfect! They were our transportation for most of the stay and the locks and lights that come with make it easy to ride around at night and not worry about parking or traffic. Edie also made sure the tires had air and the bikes were all lined up and ready to go when we went to use them. Edie and Albert were wonderful hosts showing me where everything was and offering great tips for getting around the downtown area. In addition Edie allowed me to come a day early to stock the refrigerator to surprise my girlfriends. Once there she offered me the bungalow for that night with no charge. I have no words to explain how thankful we all are. Two of my friends flights were delayed until midnight so if it wasn't for Edie's generosity we would have found ourselves driving until one in the morning to head up north for one night.

295275,1967710,8/13/2012,Ralph,"        Bang for the buck. Clean plenty of room enough tile in the home to cover a football field (LOL). Plenty of parking at this home in a quiet neighborhood with immediate access to First Street with easy connections to wherever you want to go. That is important as you want to stay off I-35 as much as possible. 
         The entertainment next door was not mentioned in the ad. A beautiful bright red macaw or parrot occupies it's 10 feet high home structure in the back yard of the home to the west of this place. Acrobatics squawks for attention and spoken phrases such as "" here bird here bird""  was uttered upon the arrival of a native wild bird. Very delightful! Our back yard here was a nice size and privacy fenced 6 feet high.
          We were stunned at the attention and helpfulness displayed by Joseph. Best host we have seen and we are in our 60's. The location cleanlieness and quality of this home is worth $30- $75 more a day than is being charged.  ",Stylish 3/2/2 with large backyard,1282837,Joseph

622062,1976477,8/13/2012,Tori,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Aimee's artist studio a couple of weekends ago during a quick trip to Austin. We were out and about much of the day and night but the place made a nice refuge on Saturday evening. It's conveniently located relatively near the Whole Foods the 6th St scene and a really tasty coffee shop. The pictures of the apartment are true to life and I enjoyed looking at all of the art on the wall and generally taking in the quaint antique vibe I'll probably never be able to pull off myself. Overall the place was cozy and bright and stayed pretty cool given the temperature hit 104 degrees the weekend we were in town. There was also lots of street parking in the area. Aimee was very responsive and seemed happy to answer questions though we had few. 
  
My boyfriend and I had just a couple of minor critiques on what was overall a brief but pleasant stay. 

1. The ladder to the loft bed is positioned in front of a chest of drawers. The stairs have a tendency to rest on the decorative lip of the chest which is scary. You wouldn't want to break the furniture trying to climb up or down. This was more a problem for my boyfriend than me and could be easily resolved I'd wager. 

2. Someone's cat seemed very interested to get into the studio and we had to keep shooing him away particularly as we were leaving. I'm allergic so wasn't too keen on getting close. If the cat is a regular house guest in the studio that's worth mentioning in the rental description. It also meowed quite a bit at night when we got back to the place and again in the morning. 

3. The bathroom is very basic especially the shower. It met our needs fine and Amy was upfront about this when we spoke but a picture of that area would be helpful to give people a sense up front. Especially for those taking trips longer than one night. ",Artist Studio in Downtown Austin,437941,Aimee

244785,1995575,8/15/2012,Ali + Dave,For my first trip to Austin and my first Airbnb experience I am absolutely thrilled and hooked on both. I was initially intrigued by the Aerie Guest House because it is energy efficient and built by the Zars. When we first walked in the first thing you smell is fresh wood. The house has a very minimal design and was very clean and comfortable. The only thing that would make this house even better is a kitchen area as one of the benefits of staying at a house is to be able to prepare some of your meals. But this allowed us to explore Austin's many amazing restaurants. The location of the house is great and only a short drive bike ride or run to many fun spots in the area. I would definitely recommend this house to anyone who wants to have a more intimate cozy and unique experience in Austin. ,Mid Week Special!!,1284548,Gwen & Richard

622062,2196309,9/4/2012,John,"Aimee's place is just as advertised - a small cottage in the rear of a larger home with a very cute efficient layout.  The neighborhood seemed very safe and is located walking distance from the HQ Whole Foods store on Lamar & 6th.  It was a 100 degree weekend but the AC worked like a charm and we were sufficiently cool.  There's no TV but a nice stereo with a long input jack for your music player.  Italian expresso maker microwave and two hot plates were available for any cooking you want to do.   If you want to do some gourmet cooking then keep looking but if you are like us we were out for every meal and only used the expresso maker.  Whole Foods can provide anything else you might want.

Aimee communicated well throughout the reservation process.  She left written instructions for operating her stereo turning on the AC and lights etc.  Though we were not able to meet her Aimee made herself available by cell phone for questions or emergencies.

I want to share a few things that weren't mentioned or weren't clear to us before staying at Aimee's place.  The main bed is located in a ""homemade"" loft with access via climbing an attic ladder.  If you are uncomfortable with heights (there are no railings once you're in the loft) then consider sleeping on the very comfortable pull-out couch bed in the living room.  The bathroom layout is unique and the shower is a bit tight for large people but everything is very clean and functional.  The driveway is a bit narrow leading down to the cottage but there is ample street parking if you prefer not to squeeze in.

We didn't have to drive far at all to get to any of those places. We really enjoyed spending time on his back patio in between activities. David greeted us upon arrival and was quite kind.

368156,2209616,9/5/2012,Andrew,"Just a few things of note that kept this from being an ideal stay:
- In the room where we stayed (the one closest to the door) the overhead fan was also connected to the overhead light. In order to cool the room off we'd have to turn on the fan/light which isn't the best option when you're trying to sleep. 
- Two dogs (listed under amenities) one of which is just a yapper not a big deal. The other is a sizable St. Bernard(?) pretty aggressive at first (pounds on the door) but calms down eventually. It would have been nice to at least get a heads up about the dogs being on the aggro side especially if you're someone who's not used to being around them.
- In our room we found the bed to have some issues with squeaking even just moving around in our sleep we'd wake up from the noise. For those who might be staying in that room our quickfix was to push the bed against the wall.
- Our room had a feature which limited our privacy somewhat: a large opening above the door (presumably to increase the central air flow). It made it so it was hard to feel at ease since whatever conversations we might be having or noise we might ve making could be heard by anyone in the living room. I think this oughta be noted in the AirBnB ad since we probably wouldn't have taken it otherwise.
- When I mentioned the issue of the light/fan combo to Matt he kind of shruggingly admitted that he was aware of the problem and needed to fix it but didn't seem like it was high on his list of things to do at that moment. The bed squeaking also didn't get much of a reaction either.
- That said it's a prime location clean house and seriously cheap. and most all of these problems can either be remedied or at least spelled out in greater detail in advance.",Private Room B With Bath on SOCO,1348968,SoCoBnB /Matt

After comparing notes with the other wedding guests we sure hit the jackpot. Kris' place was far more comfortable convenient and affordable. We found the place to be charming homey and stocked with everything we could need for our stay. The space is well furnished yet spacious and open. The bedding and towels were super soft! Kris' place is in an ideal location too! It took us seven minutes to get to the heart of downtown and not much longer to get to North Austin. The neighborhood is safe and chock full of coffee shops restaurants and stores. The best part of our stay was the hostess herself. Kris was so kind and welcoming and went way above and beyond to make sure not only our stay in the house was great but that our entire trip was. When my luggage arrived quite late and I was faced with wearing dirty clothes to a wedding Kris came to the rescue! Kris left some treats to welcome us upon check-in and also provided a booklet of her yelp reviews to ensure we knew the neighborhood's best eateries and brew houses.

There was this cute little cat that was very helpful in showing the way to your  guest house if the path was too dark to see sometimes. The location is in a nice and quite neighborhood with plenty of coffee shops and eatery nearby such as Franklin Barbecue which is a must go to for bbq if you are in Austin. If you are not a morning person I recommend bringing an eye mask as there are no window shades in the 2nd floor bedroom and the light will beam right into your eyes.

46929,2225656,9/7/2012,Carolyn,"My husband and I needed a place to recharge but we didn't want to go too far away. Fortunately I found Maze BnB.

Anthony met us when we arrived and took us around the back to the suite then showed us how everything worked and where everything was. He was very cordial! 

The lock on the front door is a keypad so there was no need to worry about losing keys. The suite was extremely comfortable although the decor was rather bland particularly for Austin so if you're looking for funky decor this isn't the place. However it is absolutely spotlessly clean and the bathroom more than makes up for the lack of art. The Japanese soaking tub is big enough for two although with just one I was able to lie down with only a slight bend of my knees. The water was HOT and endless which was a dream for me. I could have stayed under the dual head shower forever.

The sitting room has a small love seat and a chair with another chair at the desk. There is a 26 inch LCD television a stereo with CD player and lots of books and magazines on Austin. The bedroom is perfect for a long-term stay as there is a ton of storage including a dresser and a long wall of closets. The architecture is very Zen with high ceilings lots of natural wood and a ton of light. As a photographer I was envious of the giant windows. However they must be double pane as the suite never got hot even with all the direct sunlight.

The sheets were thick and smooth and heavenly. There were plenty of blankets and there is a lamp with a plug and USB port for charging electronics. The suite includes a small dorm size refrigerator perfect for chilling wine beer or water (which was kindly provided with two bottles already waiting) or storing leftovers. A microwave sits atop the fridge and a Senseo pod coffee maker is in the bathroom. There were typed instructions on how to use everything which was greatly appreciated.

This is the perfect place to stay very centrally located and walking distance to Lake Austin (about five blocks). The neighborhood is upscale and very safe.

Our room was actually more like a studio separate from the house with our own entry through the back gate. Very clean cozy and private. The main house is spacious and beautiful and he also rents out rooms there. We met a couple staying in one of those rooms and they seemed very happy with it.

His house in about one mile from downtown but there's a bus that stops about one block away that will get you there in about 10 minutes and a late-night owl bus that goes back and stops just a couple blocks away from his place. The neighborhood he lives is very lively with great cafes shops bars and food carts. We enjoyed hanging out there even more than downtown.

We left early in the morning and never got to meet Matt in person but he was very nice over the phone and we would highly recommend staying at his place to anyone visiting Austin.",A Baby suite on SoCo in room bath,1348968,SoCoBnB /Matt

120230,2469319,10/1/2012,Sindey,"This was my first Airbnb booking and I absolutely loved staying at Lisa's darling condo near Zilker Park.  I highly recommend staying at Lisa's over a hotel while in Austin.  The best part of the condo is its location.  It is centrally located and very easy to get to and from anywhere in the Austin vicinity.  Although I did not get to meet Lisa in person I felt very welcome in her condo.  It was very clean loved having access to a kitchen plus wifi.  I'm not certain as to Lisa's profession but she sure knows how to decorate.  If you need some design ideas/inspiration- this is the place to stay.  Her sand wall collection is a design element I'm taking away with me for my future travels.  It was also nice that her neighbors are quiet as I really did not hear them (be it above or next door).  

If you need food the condo is close to the flagship Whole Foods as well as Central Markets.  The drugstore is also nearby as well as Target for other supplies like insect repellant.  I felt very safe in the neighborhood and in the complex.

I highly recommend strolling through the Umlauf Sculpture Garden which is very close in proximity.  I wasn't sure what to expect but it was one of those pleasant surprises.

FYI: The only thing lacking was a microwave in the kitchen.  If you need an iron and ironing board be sure to ask Lisa prior to arriving as I didn't see one in the condo (not that I needed one) and if you need hangers also ask for these prior to your arrival.  There are plenty of hooks in the bedroom bathroom and dining room.  Lastly if you need to watch tv bring your laptop and surf on Hulu as there is no cable in the condo.
If you're not going out and plan on having a quiet night in there are plenty of books and magazines available.

Don't delay book your reservation with Lisa.  The next time I'm in Austin I hope that this condo will be available for my stay.

Greg and Mary were very communicative and polite.  Like all the reviews said - the fridge was stocked with goodies so I did not have to run out to the store for coffee sugar soda milk etc.  The place was very quiet and equally clean.  It's very conveniently located from the airport and is really close to the downtown (which is great for going out to bars and restaurants).  I used their bike to go into downtown for lunch and the neighborhood is very cute.  There seemed to be a lot of restaurants within a mile.  Greg was actually able to pick me up from the airport - which was a huge bonus (not guaranteed - just pending their schedule).  I did not have a car but it looked like parking was really easy and safe.  They have a great little front porch and an amazing back porch.  The wifi was extremely helpful and I was able to watch some football on TV.  This was so much more convenient nice and personable than a hotel and I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Austin.  I was also in a jam for printing and was able to use Greg and Mary's printer.  I can't say enough nice things.

This little casita in Hyde Park was exactly what I'd hoped to find.  It's in a wonderful location (especially in the summer months -- there's a public pool less than a block away) and it was so nice to be able to walk a few blocks and have coffee shops and great restaurants and a grocery.  The casita is lovely: a great size for one or two people for longer stays but with a super comfy futon couch for guests.

My wife and I spent four days three nights in Austin this past weekend and Lyon's bungalow was perfectly located and appointed for ensuring that our vacation would be a relaxing adventure.  In all our conversations Lyon proved to be responsive informative and helpful answering my questions quickly and thoroughly.  In fact when we first met Lyon at the bungalow he put us at ease immediately - he took the time to talk with us about our stay suggesting nearby locations for fun and food.  As we talked I mentioned that we were in Austin to attend the Texas Brew Craft Festival; he returned shortly after our tour of the bungalow with a bottle of a local trippel and offered it to us for our enjoyment.  (Lyon - it was really tasty thank you!)  

The bungalow is clean and cozy perfect for a couple like us who value quiet and privacy. Lyon had thoughtfully laid out snacks coffee and tea on the kitchen counter and the Jenn-Air fridge included several beverages - soda beer tonic water.  The bungalow is furnished sparingly yet perfectly with a small table a couch a firm Tempurpedic bed hi-def TV free wi-fi and a compact sound system ready to be plugged into your favorite music device.  The real star of the bungalow is the double shower / steam room. After walking around town all day the steam room is fantastic for unwinding tired muscles.

Downtown Austin is barely a couple minutes away by car and is well within biking distance if you choose. For those who will be traveling farther in the area I35 is only blocks away. The flagship Whole Foods Market is less than ten minutes away by car making it easy for us to pick up some fresh fruits tasty cheeses and a nice wine to enjoy at the bungalow.

Only little concern is that you might not want to walk home at night and taxis can be hard to get hold of. The suite itself is really cosy and with nice decor.

This is what I enjoy about airbnb: rather than yet another generic hotel staying here feels like an authentic slice of life in Austin.  I also loved that the apartment is walking distance from good coffee Nau's Enfield Drug and a quick drive up the way to Magnolia Cafe.  Her apartment is also close enough to downtown to reach without the noise and stress of actually staying downtown.

The space is very comfortable: a huge fluffy bed good air conditioning hot water.  The ladder to the loft space seems frightening at first but is completely safe and secure.  As mentioned in other reviews the shower is small but clean and perfectly serviceable.

I didn't want to rent a car so it needed to be within walking distance of the festival shopping and dining.  It also needed to be somewhat affordable.  In the area I was looking at there was not much left except $300-400 hotel rooms.  Luckily I found Kristin's apartment and it fit the bill 100%.

There are several restaurants nearby plus a large grocery store.  Everything I needed was within a 15 minute walk.  The apartment itself is not large but for one or two people that need a place to sleep after a long day in Austin it's just fine.  It is near a busy city street so expect to hear some traffic noise and sirens.  I also awoke once or twice early in the morning to some loud activity in the business park next door.  These things don't bother me but others might be sensitive to it.

She communicated really well before our check in and provided me with all the check in information i needed well before we arrived.  She was even able to accommodate an early check in.  We were in Austin for ACL and this place is perfect for it.  It is a 30min walk or you can walk up to South Congress and get a shuttle or pedi cab in if you can't be bothered walking.  It is also a short walk into Downtown and 6th street or a $10 cab ride.  It is also located close to bars and restaurants on South Congress Ave a 5min walk away.  The house itself is just beautiful and in a lovely neighbourhood.  We stayed there with 2 friends and had plenty of space.  There is a nice living area with lounge table TV and was great to just chill out in.  There is kitchen with all modern conveniences and we were able to utilise anything in the cupboards we needed.  There is also a nice backyard area where we enjoyed breakfast and also a few drinks.

I travel from NYC to Austin quite often with my boyfriend (who is an Austin native) but this time my parents wanted to come visit us from Michigan as well. To make things easier I decided an Airbnb home would be the perfect situation for all 4 of us and THIS WAS INCREDIBLE. Her home is located close to the really lively shopping/eating/drinking area of South Congress. It was gorgeous and clean. My parents were so impressed with me for arranging such a classy and comfortable/ relaxed situation for us all. 

Lisa herself was prompt and lovely to work with and she really went the extra mile with the additional touches: bottled water in the fridge selections of coffee and tea extra toiletries night lights for the hallway (new places can be disorienting in the middle of the night!) Citronella candles for the backyard etc.

There is just a lot of thought put into her abode and it was such a treat to stay in a place that had modern touches in all the right places without forsaking the unique vintage quirks of the home. We all woke up in the morning after great nights of sleep and just enjoyed the tranquility of having coffee out on the porch or while sitting at the dining room table gazing at the huge trees through the picture window

10. Close to other hotels and airbnb rentals. (Many of our guests got places within walking distance which made it easy to meet up with them before and after the wedding.)

Unfortunately it was a little too chilli out to swim but the backyard as well as the pool were beautiful! We did sit out to eat dinner. Jose was very accommodating. He allowed us to check in and out at anytime. I seriously kept pushing back the checkout time because I did not want to leave the couch! Jose responded to my emails very fast. His family was out of town so he provided me with his brother's number in case I needed assistance immediately. there were plenty of toiletries and towels for us to use.

Not only is the location great for everything (so central that for $1 we took a bus from the airport and only had to walk a few blocks to the space) but he was in touch and available for questions on where to go for food or fun or anything else needed. Also he was very knowledgeable and kind. Also i love music and forgot to bring proper cables to tie in to his stereo so he came and hooked some up while we were out and it worked great! The space was well kept and perfect for a couple. Also the images of the view of the Capitol building looked too good to be true but it was RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW! Truly a great way to wake up. For the last few days Congress was blocked off for a book festival but it was quiet and quite nice. Distance to the University or 6th was excellent especially if you want both or to be a bit off the main strip for some privacy.

Gray has set up a TV with a million channels DVD player and internet access in the room. I will leave off one star for cleanliness in the shower/bathroom but then again people live here so you can't expect it to be spotless. There are two very friendly dogs on site.

In particular the house was pre-stocked with food and snacks which saved us a trip to the store on our first night there.  With a toddler after a 4 hour plane trip trust me these little things matter.  There was even beer in the fridge!  (If I drank beer I'd be happy about that!)

The home was very clean comfortable and uncluttered.  I barely had to do much to make it toddler-friendly.  Our hosts were available when we needed them and very accomodating.  Basically I don't see any reason to stay anywhere else when we're in Austin - the price for 2 bedroom with a kitchen was half what you'd pay for a nice hotel room and you would not have all the space you have here.

252804,2784510,11/2/2012,Elizabeth,"This was a tremendous location and an EXTREMELY comfortable home!  It just felt 'right'! One room flows easily to the next.  The spaces of the living room dining room patio off the dining room and the kitchen are 'open' and easy for conversation and all the seating and beds are very comfortable.  With 2.5 baths and 4 women we were never frustrated by lack of accessibility.  It had amenities galore and had we been there longer and/or if NO ONE was familiar with the town [one of us was] we would still have been set with all the reference and tour books in the bookcase.  There was so much food in the cupboard and various kinds of spices in the rack and types of extras in the refrigerator that I hesitated to eat ANYTHING that was already there when we arrived my first thought being ""Does Brooks actually LIVE here??  How does he clear out so easily and so fast!?!""  I guess he really doesn't but with all the food available I preferred not to take a chance!  We decided that it was likely food stuffs left behind by previous guests.  Still we got our own and mostly ate out.  We did help ourselves for hot tea in the mornings though.  I love the white IKEA dish set that Brooks has... and his simple but cool taste in decorating a bit ethnic and 'world traveler' kinds of things for accents yet his house has a simple modern feel.  The HUGE world map on the wall beside the dining room table was VERY cool for us and led us to various kinds of travel conversations.  The outside patio table beneath the permanent awning (through the dining room glass doors) was a perfect spot for one of us who smokes [not me :)] and a relaxing spot to just sit and feel pleasantly 'in' the back yard.  The neighbourhood feels totally safe... and it's nearby to where some very interesting stores and restaurants are on South Congress... where we spent the majority of the first whole day of our brief stay.  We didn't use any of the numerous games that some adults and children will find delightful to have right there for them.  We all expressed wanting to own such a sweet and comfortable home and even started thinking in terms of doing an airbnb in the various places where we DO live.  Will definitely continue using airbnb for future travels.  Seriously HOPING I can return to Austin one day... what a great town... and a whole lot more to see than I got a chance to see!  Seeing Leonard Cohen perform was superb however!  Brooks was very cooperative in our communications ahead of time so there was no need to contact him once we were there... hence we never met.  It's clear that he expects people to be responsible and act like adults.  Would not hesitate to stay again with Brooks if I return to Austin a delightful town.

350282,2786216,11/2/2012,Dick,"We agree completely will all of the other positive reviews. I'll just add a couple of things we did in Austin I haven't seen mentioned.
We arrived by car at the end of a a two-week Texas vacation. It was great to be able to securely park off-street and access was of course easy the one time we needed our car. That was to visit the LBJ Presidential Library & Museum which was less than a ten minute drive on the University of Texas campus. There's free parking there; hard to find in Austin. Otherwise we walked... no more than 15 minutes to the heart of 6th Street; perhaps 20 to the Texas State Capitol where we enjoyed a guided tour; ten minutes to the famed Franklin Barbecue... or took the bus for further travel. A 24 hour unlimited-use pass is just $2.00. 
One other ""attraction"" that hasn't been mentioned we found worthwhile... the Texas State Cemetery is a two minute-walk. We spent over an hour watching a video & then walking the grounds in search of the gravesites of the famous Texans buried there as well as enjoying the peace tranquility and beauty. 
There's one opinion I will parrot. Greg & Mary are terrific hosts and the house is an unbeatable value. Totally satisfied! ",1 Bedroom House Close to Downtown!,1709384,Greg And Mary

Communication was flawless and they proactively made sure I had all the info I needed prior to check-in. The keypad entry meant I didn't even need to fuss about a particular time for key exchanges (which turned out to be so helpful as I spent far more time at the airport waiting for colleagues than I had anticipated). A custom welcome message was waiting for us when we arrived along with a list of suggestions for local spots we might enjoy (we went straight for the Tex-Mex first thing and it didn't disappoint!) The decor of the house totally matched my taste and the pictures--I couldn't get over the prints in the bedroom I chose. Artful and hilarious.

I can't stress enough how carefully these hosts have thought through what guests will need and enjoy during their stay. From a hairdryer to coffee to cleaning supplies that help you keep things tidy during your stay it's all there waiting. On a transportation note: I was glad I'd rented a car as it would have been difficult to get around/do errands otherwise. That's true of lots of spots in Austin and I expected it going in so no surprises there.

There is no TV which is fine because there's so much to do in Austin. And it's nice to have a fridge sink and stove handy. Matt was very accommodating in terms of when I checked in and he gave me some tips on excellent local cafes and shops.  His place is conveniently located right off of South Congress super close to restaurants cafes and some really cool vintage stores. There are plenty of buses but I walked almost everywhere. It's about a 30 to 40-minute walk to downtown and the Sixth Street bars. My only criticism was there was no hairdryer in the bathroom. 
Also he has two dogs and one that is fairly excitable. It's fine if you're a fan of dogs but I'm a bit uncomfortable around large dogs so I always had one eye looking out for it running towards me when I was in the backyard. Again it wasn't that bad I'm just not a big dog person.

Edie and Alberto were great folks who even went out of their way to pick us up at the airport. The neighborhood is full of houses built in the 1920s which are being remodeled and restored.  The bungalow has a very modern fully-equipped kitchen and bathroom as one can see by the photos and Alberto's workmanship was beautiful!

Aimee's place appeared as it did in the photos- quaint and quirky. We were disappointed to find that the bathroom did not have a door and the kitchen sink is the only one. Also the fold-down couch was not terribly comfortable. I think the space would be best suited for two close friends (willing to share a bed) or a couple.

Super flexible and easy to communicate with as we tried to confirm if the great Frankenstorm of 2012 would cause our trip from Brooklyn to Austin to be canceled. A wonderfully quiet place. Perfect for two people. The futon was surprisingly comfortable-- more so than some hotels we've stayed at-- and fit my 6-foot 6-month pregnant frame with plenty of room left over for my husband perfectly. No foot hang! A water-stocked fridge had a couple of cold ones also waiting for us when we arrived. Ate out so much we didn't take advantage of the microwave or coffee maker but it was good to know it was there. Gorgeous garden (seriously---- this garden is amazing) great location to Austin happenings overall a laid-back pleasant experience.

There is also free laundry in the apartment complex. And honestly the bed was more comfortable than my own and I own a supposedly expensive Sealy posturepedic or something.

I traveled from Oregon and was not disappointed! Susan had every detail prepared in advance and her apartment was perfect for our stay.  This place is in a beautiful neighborhood and is close to Lake Austin and downtown.  Although there is a Senseo coffee maker provided I had mentioned to her that I prefer a French Press.  Lo and behold she provided one for me.  :)  When I requested an extra blanket she gave me two.   I loved Austin and hope to return.

Like others said the bathroom does only have a curtain and is right next to the bed... but if you go with someone you are super close with this shouldn't be an issue. Also it is true what they say the parking out front is incredibly easy and not something to worry about at all. 
We didn't meet Fiona while we were there but she made it super easy to get in and out... and also didn't bug us about a check out time which was helpful the day after a rowdy wedding ;-).",Sweet Sexy Studio in the '02,688306,Fiona

70812,2894448,11/16/2012,Jere,Great apartment!  The location is unbeatable--only a block from a parade of shops and restaurants that stretch down S. Congress and less than a mile from Lady Bird Lake--and the apartment is nicely laid out with a serviceable kitchen and separate bedroom.  I worked part of the month that I stayed in the apartment and I was especially impressed with the wireless Internet service.  My only negative--and just for those of you especially sensitive to noise--is the neighborhood dogs.  (Not Michael's dogs--they're friendly and well-behaved.)  I was woken a few times by other dogs usually around the time that I get up anyway and the noise only caused a small bother now and then.  That small problem wouldn't stop me from renting the apartment again and indeed I hope to book it for my next trip to Austin.  Nine out of 10!

The master bedroom and bath are A+. I'm gonna steal that comfortable bed set up idea! The house has full amenities should you need them. And although I have no kids it's kid friendly as well. You'll be entertained by two finches in the house Popo and Pip but rest assured you'll never hear them unless you walk by them in the den. They are characters. Aside from the stunning pictures which represents the property accurately the neighborhood is quiet but not dead! It's a cute area with an artsty feel but not hippie. Upper casual class with quaint style. There are nearby (walking) restaurants and cafe's which offer character. No chain corporate types but local merchants. Everybody is nice and you feel welcome. The location is also very accessible (by car) to downtown with Hwy 35 entry ramp less than a mile away. Downtown is 10-15 minutes. UT is like 7 minutes.

While making arrangements we found that the hotels were doing an ""event number"" on the rates as in an $80 motel room for $350.  A friend referred us to AirBnB.  We were someone apprehensive due to a prior internet booking that was not successful. Upon arriving in Austin at Linda's home we immediately knew that we had made a right decision  in booking with  Lia and Linda. They were gracious and helpful beyond any expectations. The home was made available to us including use of the dining and living space as well as the kitchen and laundry facilities.  Linda helped with ideas for getting around in the city especially since this was our first trip to Austin.  She also offered  aid with transportation during the weekend when she was not at work.  There were also two other guests in the home sharing the second bedroom.  They were brothers who had come from Vancouver BC Canada to also attend the race and some of the social activities in downtown connected with the race event .  We had some quite pleasant interaction with the young men as we had the same common interests to do with the race as well as talking about our Canadian travels. An interesting side note to our stay was that we discovered Linda not only knew the only other people that we had visited with upon our arrival in Austin but she had done some joint work projects with the woman and her husband. The stay ended with Linda selecting a local restaurant where the five of us had a great evening prior to our departure.

The house itself is quite novel with a unique layout and modern design that makes it fun to walk through and experience.  We had plenty of room for the four of us and enjoyed the nice artistic touches throughout.

One of the best BBQ place in Austin is only 2 blocks away (Franklin BBQ is only open for lunch until sold out). You can also find a CVS a block away.

Unfortunately we did need her during the visit for a situation with the shower. When we woke up on the first day of our visit the water was not running in the shower. I called Andi and she came right away. She called the plumber and he was able to come in the afternoon. Andi was apologetic and actually offered that I use her shower at her own home that morning which I did. It was a bit awkward to have to go to her house and shower there before a day of business meetings. She also provided a 20% discount for the inconvenience. That evening the shower was up and running.

76501,3047035,12/8/2012,Shawn,"If you have checked out Kevin's listing & thought for even a moment about staying at his & his partner's upstairs flat (second level of a duplex) in the French Place/Cherrywood neighborhood of East Austin take my advice & go for it right this minute. 

I have lived in Austin for more than a decade (& lived in some fantastic spots in Travis Heights Rosedale Crestview/Brentwood & Hyde Park along the way) but needed a place for a few days while in between a move & some extended travel. Kevin worked with me on short notice & was responsive intuitive & helpful the whole time while also granting every ounce of privacy I needed (which is no problem with two private entrances anyway). 

Like anyone reading this I also find great joy in traveling as often as humanly possible. As soon as you set foot inside this inspired achievement of a living space your initial reaction might be akin to mine – dropping your bags & your jaw & saying to no one in particular that ""this is outrageously awesome"" – or you might just quietly admire the lovely eclectic & warm apartment. Five hours later you might actually remember you're on a trip & have stuff to do. Fair warning: The place will put you in a trance. The great books generous bar strong wi-fi DirecTV & Goldilocks-level-of-perfection bed don't hurt either. 

When you're finally ready to hit the streets you'll be pleased to find that you're close to everything worth doing & seeing. You'll find yourself in what is arguably the new cultural center of Austin within walking distance of Eastside nightlife & high-caliber but dirt-cheap dining UT campus & all of its surrounding charms convenient bus routes museums libraries & more. On top of it you're a two-minute drive to I-35 but barely even notice it's so nearby.

Between you & me Kevin could charge a lot more for this hidden gem. I cannot recommend it highly enough. One thing that struck me as I was researching short-term places in Austin – & I went at it with a level of seriousness usually reserved for buying a new car because I love this city & wanted to stay somewhere that best represented it before leaving for a while – is that people who had stayed here kept reporting in reviews that the ""pictures don't do it justice."" Well truer words have rarely been spoken. 

Hope you enjoy your stay as much as I did!

Not only was it clean well-lit and beautiful but Alexis had also stocked the place with just about anything you would need while traveling but would probably forget or not think to bring. One example is the lint remover I found. That really came in handy! There were also cooking utensils that we took advantage of as well as a fridge that was stocked with beverages and snacks. There were extra pillows blankets plenty of towels...we wanted for nothing! When I come back to Austin I don't plan to stay anywhere else. :)

It was clean nicely decorated and the perfect size for my husband and I. The location was good- close to all the shops on SoCo and just a short driving distance to downtown. I have to give Joe extra props for the condition of the cottage- it was very clean it smelled nice and fresh and all the finishes in the bathroom and kitchen were nicely done. Joe was very easy to communicate with and always responded promptly.

I was visiting from out of town for work and needed a place near downtown and I don't know much about Austin. Since I was driving from Cali I needed a place to park and potentially late check in and Joe readily accommodated my needs. His studio apartment is rather large very nice bed cold AC and hot heater the bathroom is fantastic and having the convenience of a kitchen with utensils is icing on the cake for those looking to save a few bucks. The rental is located in a nice quiet area yet 500 yards away is congress ave which leads into downtown 2 miles north you could literally walk it or take a bus. Even before heading downtown I found a ton of restaurants and food trucks ( l love those) and lots of cafes.

On the plus side the garden was wonderful but we were on the go so much I spent very little time in it. Dan was friendly without being intrusive and was very helpful whenever we needed him. 

Our biggest need was a comfortable clean place in which to relax at the end of the day and to sleep. We wanted the ability to fix at least a little of our own food to save money. We are on the downhill side of middle aged and the futon was a poor choice for us. It was a little hard and my pillows kept falling off the end of the futon at night. There were no night stands so my husband used one of the chairs to set up his c-pap machine on and since there are only the two chairs we moved it off an on the chair every day. What you cannot see in the photos is that the toilet is elevated and you must step up to get to it. It is turned so that if you are very tall your knees are against the wall in front of the toilet. The sink is positioned so that if you stand directly in front of it your right leg is up a step and your left leg is down. There is also a steep step down from the shower be careful so you do not fall. 

The small microwave is underneath the fridge so you have to get down on the floor to see the numbers on the front of it. That was a little tricky especially for my husband with neuropathy in his feet. 
There is a shortage of flat surfaces to set things on but Dan was very receptive to these suggestions and they may be remedied very soon.

We were looking for a place to spend our very first Christmas away from our family home in Michigan as two of our children now live in the Austin area and one was flying in from California. We love Christmas and were thrilled to arrive to find the house decorated for the holidays. The house was very clean and welcoming crisp linens on the beds and I was thrilled to find a very well equipped kitchen.
Eggs bread fruit milk and coffee were left for us to enjoy plus information on how to access the internet and TV.
The house is very well located to get to downtown and North Austin and is in a very family friendly neighborhood.  We all enjoyed our stay in Courtney's home and would highly recommend it.",Newly Renovated Central House!,583537,Courtney

Close to a Randal's Central Market Target loads of great restaurants and main highways. The house is clean bright and well equipped for hosting a few guests... we served 12 for a Christmas Day lunch of prime rib with all of the traditional festive fixings. We had 5 adults and a two-year old grandson staying all very comfortable with a single bed to spare. Lots of daytime guests. Lots of kids toys in the loft kept a few kids busy and happy never a dull moment! Christmas lights outside and a decorated tree made it just about like ""being at home for the holidays.""  Parking is tight and limited but was sufficient. Neighbors and nights were quiet and peaceful.

We enjoyed walking to nearby restaurants and easy access to downtown Austin. Although temps were near freezing the space heaters were more than adequate to keep us cozy. 

We did have some difficulty sleeping soundly the first night because we heard the heater cycling on/off and some noises outside like acorns falling on the roof. Second night was great probably because we were used to the environment and modified the heater settings!

The architecture and design are gorgeous and we loved all the light from the floor to ceiling windows. It was immaculately clean when we arrived with organic fair-trade coffee and scones for us left on the counter (which were delicious!). The working fireplace was great as we were able to make s'mores. The two balcony spaces were awesome and would be even better when it's a little warmer out. We met Michelle and her two dogs all of whom are very sweet and welcoming :). The bed and couches are all comfortable.

644773,3197252,12/31/2012,Diane,"Just wanted to leave a note to say how nice my stay was at El's Place.  Simon and his wife left to go out of town the day I arrived and we were unable to meet in person  - we chatted a few times on the phone and he was very kind personable and helpful.  I rated my overall experience with 4 out of 5 stars only because the weather took a turn for the cold (actually freezing at night) and I didn't get to enjoy relaxing on the beautiful front porch enjoying the Hill County air like I wished but inside was cozy and warm.  The house was very clean enormous well stocked kitchen & bathroom and the bedroom was very cute.  On a warm Spring day you could open the patio doors in the bedroom that step out to the porch and take a nice breezy nap.  Just to note: I was alone on my trip for relaxation from my chaotic Houston life but Simon's little paradise is large enough for a family with 2 children - there is a day trundle bed in the living room for the little ones.  Oh forgot to mention the herd of deer that stopped by in the mornings at dawn to say hello smiles!

Thank you Simon :^)
Hopefully be back early late Spring or early Summer

Jason himself provided excellent support to us.  The neighborhood had an unfortunate power outage.  The cabana's breaker probably got overloaded when power was restored but Jason had somebody out within an hour to take care of it.  It's one of those things but it was handled graciously.

The only feedback I would suggest is better privacy coverings for the windows and maybe a throw rug here and there especially in the bathroom.  That concrete floor is cold.

320466,3198974,12/31/2012,Yvonne,"The house was unique and quite a treat.  We gathered for  a weekend trip and felt a house would be easier to mingle and enjoy our time without running between rooms at a hotel.  I've stayed in vacation rentals and this is the first that it was a primary residence.  Christian met us Friday evening gave us a tour of his home then left for the weekend while we enjoyed his home. It was a perfect location to downtown and we took a quick cheap cab ride to 6th Street.  Our intentions were to grill  and enjoy the 2 balconies but it was so cold during our visit that we merely ran up and down and took in the awesome views of Austin. The actual neighborhood is a potpourri of homes from older unkept homes to neighboring contemporary modern homes like Christian's.  It might seem unsafe but we never felt a concern.  We drove to SoCo for food trucks and ate breakfast at Juan in a Million just minutes away.  I would highly recommend this home for a big group.  For what ever reason no one could reuse their bath towels  & for the double showering daily of the group we used every towel he had (which was a lot). There a quite a few stairs to enter  the house as well in the house so if that is a problem I would think twice about booking this home.  It wasn't a problem for us and we would do it all over again.  Christian was a great host. Enjoy the balconies yard & awesome sound system in and outside the house!
