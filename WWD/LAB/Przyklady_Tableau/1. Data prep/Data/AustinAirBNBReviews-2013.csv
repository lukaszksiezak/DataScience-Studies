727748,3208061,1/1/2013,Jennifer,"I rented Anne's house for a long weekend family gathering post Christmas / pre New Years.

Renter: Anne was nice and helpful. She stocked Coffee Milk Juice and fruits for us to use. There were even toiletries in little baskets in the bathrooms for us to use. She was in the city and easy to contact and stopped by to welcome us. 

House:
Pros: 
-The design of the house was very cool looking.
-There were different comfortable areas to sit and hang out.
-With four bedrooms it felt very comfortable for our group of seven people. 
-The master shower is pretty huge with four different shower heads that can all turn on at the same time.
-There was a Christmas tree and lights which gave the house a nice festive touch.
-In addition to the wifi there was a computer in the kitchen that we used to play music which was awesome.  
-The location was convenient.
-The neighborhood was cute and quiet. In warmer months walking around would be nice.
-In warmer months the back yard looks like it'd be a nice place to hang out drink coffee talk etc. 
Cons: 
-The house was kinda loud. Some people liked to go to bed earlier than others and in every room even the master bedroom you could hear the people in the common areas.  
- If you don't own a dog have allergies wear black pants or like to walk around barefoot then you may notice that this is a home that has a dog. We found dog hair all over the floor and all over the couches. Wasn't terrible only one seat had a dog smell which was probably his favorite spot. The dog owners didn't notice but it did bother some people.
- We paid a $40 cleaning fee and the house rules made throwing the sheets in the laundry room and the starting the dishwasher seem more like a rule than a suggestion. We would have done it either way but it seemed strange for a rule considering the cleaning fee.

The overall consensus of my group was that we'd be happy to rent this house in the future but it we would also be open to renting other homes. ",ACL. Formula 1. SXSW-Perfect Home!,3771301,Anne

69810,3215979,1/2/2013,Heather,"This is a long overdue review for Dolina and her absolutely charming guest house. My partner and I were in Austin for the first time for a friend's wedding over New Year's Eve (phone number hidden)) which was being held at nearby Mercury Hall. Given the timing of the event we decided it would be ideal if we could find a place to stay within walking distance of the venue and we could not have been more pleased to find this property.

Firstly I wanted to say that Dolina was very prompt in her responses to our initial inquiries and very obliging in providing additional information about transport issues the surrounding neighborhoods and the city in general. This made planning a lot easier since we were in unfamiliar territory. When we arrived we couldn't have been more pleased with the casita. The space is thoughtfully arranged and decorated very clean and feels quite private. (My partner wondered more than once whether we ought to leave our Sydney apartment and build ourselves a little home modeled on this one out in the Australian bush!) Dolina politely left us to our own devices but was always readily available if we needed anything.

We would quite happily stay here again and would recommend the property unreservedly to anyone who was keen to stay in the area. In terms of value for money you certainly can't beat it. ",Cozy Casita Near Downtown in SoCo,82762,Dolina

692220,3248491,1/3/2013,Drew,"Our stay at Garret's place was really nice. It was clean comfortable and even stocked with a few beers he left in the fridge for us. He also let us use a couple of his bikes since we didn't have a car and they worked out great for us. We were able to get around town easily from his place. It was maybe a 10-15 minute bike ride to downtown and there were lots of great places to eat and drink that were within biking distance.

Garret was very easy to work with and gave us some great recommendations on places to go and things to do. He was out of town when we arrived but stopped by later in our stay to help us with a flat bike tire. He seemed like a nice guy and was really helpful.

Though overall our stay was great there were just a couple negatives. Right before we arrived a cold front moved in to Austin and it got pretty cold. The place had two space heaters but it wasn't quite enough to keep it at a cozy temperature. Something you probably don't need to worry about normally in Austin but it was quite a bit colder than usual this time of year.

We arrived 45 mins late and Matt was very helpful and accommodating.  He kindly  told us that we could call or text him at any time. Wifi is available which was great.  We are a couple in our 60's and this was our first airbnb experience.  The following review is based on our personal preferences and is not a reflection of Matt or the information given by him but we hope it will be helpful to other people at our ""stage of the game""  We did not have good weather in Austin and the apartment has no comfortable place to sit and read a book - the only seating is 2 hard kitchen chairs.  There are no windows in the apartment - the doors have glass in them but for privacy the blinds need to be closed.  If you are tall the shower will be a problem for you.  There were no drinking glasses wine glasses coffee filters - only 2 mugs and a few plates no chest of drawers.  The cupboard door was broken off its hinges and could not be closed.

The studio had everything we needed to be comfortable. It was surprisingly cold for Austin while we were visiting and the small heater worked great. The location was exactly what we were hoping for. A cute and quirky Austin neighborhood a few minutes drive from downtown. 

The only suggestion I could make for future renters is to arrive before dark or bring a flashlight! Dan has a great garden that includes a lot of cacti. We had to navigate around them in the dark by the light of our phones...

Its situated in a quiet neighbourhood which adds to the home away from home feel.

Andy and Ellen go above and beyond by providing fresh organic foods paraben-free toiletries good linens great restaurant recommendations guides and directions an awesome radio (Austin has terrific stations!) really good books and 2 bikes with helmets all in good condition. They even allow you to use their washer and dryer! They were very gracious easy and laid back hosts. There were a couple of pretty MINOR drawbacks: the heater is a tad on the loud side the bikes needed a little cleaning before use (just a quick rinse really) and the neighbors were doing what seemed like a small renovation project a couple of days which wouldn't normally be a big deal but we were trying to escape our landlord's endless renovations and wanted to lay around and read in the mornings. Please don't let these little things discourage you from staying here (we just like to be totally up front and thorough). We had a wonderful time and instantly felt right at home.

705858,3345889,1/14/2013,Nicole,Bill's place is wonderful!  You can tell that he and his wife enjoy hosting because they've paid attention to every detail.  They knew I was in town for my birthday and had a balloon on the door when I arrived.  Upon entering the apt. you're greeted by the smell of a freshly cleaned home and quirky sculpture showing you the way upstairs. At the top the place is simply and tastefully decorated.  Everything is top of the line.  They've maximized the space with a seating area where you can enjoy the magazines and many books about Austin and the area that they've left to share.  There's a kitchen space with coffee and all the fixings and they even stock the fridge with some surprise goodies.  The bed and linens are very comfortable and at night you get a view of the congress building downtown.  The bathroom while small had everything: nice bathrobes body wash shampoo & conditioner and very nice towels.  In fact even my husband commented that if might be time for nicer towels at home!  It's pretty cute they even leave a toothbrush and razor in case you've forgotten yours.  The proximity to South Congress is perfect.  Close enough to walk to everything but far enough to get a quiet night of sleep.  Privacy was no issue.  I think I saw the homeowners come and go a couple of times but I never met them.  However with the handwritten note and fresh flowers they leave I felt very welcomed.  It would be a pleasure to visit Bill's place again. ,Luxury Carriage House-Travis Height,3626574,Bill

The accommodations went above and beyond  - coffee tea (email hidden)! Not to mention fresh towels linens books and a full kitchen. We saved a lot of money eating breakfast in the house before romping around each day. The location was great - beautiful safe and convenient.

69352,3376239,1/20/2013,Sondra,"We had a wonderful time at the cottage.  Souvay has fabulous taste and the cottage was very comfortable and homey.  Our granddaughters were delighted to be able to visit the chickens (and we enjoyed it too.)  

i hate to say anything negative because it is a special place but I already wrote to Souvay about a couple of minor things.  First the TV is in the bedroom.  I never watch TV in bed maybe it''s just me but I either read or sleep.  It was a problem because my husband and I keep different sleeping schedules.  I tend to go to sleep earlier while he might watch a game or some late night show after I go to bed.  That's a problem if the TV is in the bedroom.  I guess I also think it's not good Feng Shui (sp?) to have the TV in the bedroom.  

Second the cottage has an overwhelming odor of fake candle scents.  I'm all for fresh smelling things but I actually had to put one of the candles out on the porch to see if that would help.  It didn't.  

I also think the description needs to be updated.  The whole complex which contained the Alamo Draft House and other entities is being demolished and is a real eyesore.  I'm not saying that it takes away from the cottage it's self but it does make the neighborhood less appealing.  The description should be changed to reflect the changing neighborhood.  

All said I give it 4 stars.

I can be a bit high maintenance about where I stay and I was extremely satisfied with the apartment - it is clean super comfortable (especially the bed) and has everything you need.  Jacob was very easy to work with – we had a bit of a problem with the lock and he was extremely accommodating.  Compared to the cost of hotels in downtown Austin this place was a fantastic deal.

The youngest stayed with us in a crib downstairs. Erik was very accommodating by removing as much baby dangerous items as possible. Although it was not completely baby safe it was a fair accommodation. To prevent the youngest from climbing the spiral staircase we made a gate using a cardboard sheet strings and a clip to attached to the stairs rail. It worked. The location was awesome! I selected the location because it was walking distant to my husband's work. And also it was significantly cheaper than staying at a corporate housing that the company was offering.

Although small there's more practical space than if you just booked a room - and for me on my own I didn't really need anything else.  Comfy sofa great wireless internet and beers in the fridge :)

Sara was an amiable host even though I inadvertedly let one of her dogs escape on my first day!  The dogs have an expected growl to a stranger when you first arrive but once you're settled in they really just leave you alone.  Likewise once settled I didn't need to contact Sara for much else.

141550,3477932,2/4/2013,Amber,Fiona was a great host and the little cottage is straight-up adorable. I'm still newish to this Airbnb business so I showed up on the wrong doorstep (Fiona's home rather than the adjacent cottage) and she was more than gracious about it walking me over to show me how to use some appliances and such. She also gave me great input on places to eat in the area. The location is fantastic too. I headed out for a walk to one of the recommended restaurants and ended up spending the day tooling around downtown on foot. I really didn't appreciate how close this east-side spot was to everything. The state Capitol is about two miles away. The only hitch with the location is that my online maps had a little trouble finding it and so did the cab driver who came to pick me up for the airport. I think GPS really wants to put you on the next street over so it's something to keep in mind. Also I stayed here solo -- totally perfect and half the price of the Sheraton would've been -- but if I'd been with someone other than my husband the bathroom might have been too close to the bed to feel comfy. That said the bathroom is one of the coolest-looking parts of the place. All in all it's a perfect little spot to have your own kitchen in an interesting part of town rather than a stale hotel room. Definitely recommend. ,Sweet Sexy Studio in the '02,688306,Fiona
585041,3469211,2/4/2013,Kory,"I recently stayed at the Travis Heights home near SoCo for my wife's 30th birthday.  This house was chosen because of its proximity (10 minute walk) to the desirable South Congress shops and restaurants.  We certainly were not disappointed.  I can honestly say that our weekend in Austin was one of the best experiences we've had in the continental United States.  If you are down for great food live music and people watching this is the place for you.  Not only was the location great but Lindsay made our experience there easy.  She was flexible with her check-in/check-out times she was quick to respond to emails and provided wonderful recommendations as far as food and travel.  I can't wait for my next experience in Austin and wouldn't hesitate to stay at Lindsay's home again.

He was also kind enough to meet us downtown on his scooter to show us the way to the house. Me and some colleagues needed somewhere to stay for a quick weekend break in Austin. The house is really nice - comfortable clean spacious. enormous tv and i loved the bikes you can use - of which there are 3. The house is situated about a ten minute bike ride from downtown - you go underneath the MPAC and a bunch of roads on this great bike trail into town - I didnt walk it but I guess it'd be a good half hour walk maybe. So it's a good place from which to explore the city  - I'd come back again if I was with a big group - there are 4 bedrooms though we only used 3.,3/2 House On Boardwalk w/Bikes!,215755,Aaron

We also enjoyed meeting Caroline and her husband. We will certainly plan to stay here again the next time we visit our daughter and her family for any length of time and with one small caveat can confidently recommend it to others. The small caveat is that the bed is in the kitchen (or the kitchen is in the bedroom) so that if one of a couple gets up much earlier than the other and wishes to make coffee or breakfast he/she needs to be very quiet about it!,Charming Hyde Park Casita,1855238,Caroline

It's the perfect place downtown easy to get anywhere (airport too - $1 bus ride) and has a very nice interior. It looks like an interior designer came into the place and made everything look great. Plus the hosts are professionals - they email directions recommendations instructions everything you need for the trip and it made the travel into Austin very smooth getting to the apartment. If any of my friends were to go to Austin I would recommend this place so I highly recommend it to other airbnb-ers. ,Modern Loft in the Middle of Austin,1921749,Jamie

The cottage was just as we remembered it from our first trip - clean comfortable and quiet.  It is at the end of a nice residential street and very private.  We enjoy having the independence of our own separate space and really enjoy staying there.  We usually rent a car and drive downtown to South Congress but there is convenient bus service at the top of the street.

the ""house"" happens to have that rare thing--two separate beds that actually have privacy relative to each other. Most airbnb lodgings of the kind we can pay for are studios where the beds are within view of each other In this one the second bed is in a second story and curiously standing above most of the houses in this quiet safe neighborly area.

It’s beautifully furnished and immaculately looked after – it feels more like a five-star hotel than somebody’s house. Location is great too. It’s really close to Rainey Street which has some amazing bars (look it up). It’s also really close to 6th Street if that’s more your style.

The unit gets tons of great natural light!

You don't need a car--you can walk everywhere or grab the bus for just $1 (thanks to another Airbnb user for the tip on the bus from the airport for $1!). The capitol is literally a block away and we highly recommend a visit--the building is beautiful as are the grounds surrounding it. There are also lots of great places along Congress Ave just steps from the apartment and the happenin' area of SoCo (South Congress) is just a mile and a half down the road (very walkable). 

We recommend a stop at Jo's Coffee in SoCo or the Warehouse District (their 'iced turbo' is delish!) and visit the Continental Club on Thursday nights for some great music from the Whiskey Sisters. We also recommend a late night stop to the bar at Swift's Attic (315 Congress Ave)--try the blistered shishitos appetizer and fried brie dessert (you can thank us later!)--and the Cuidado: Piso Mojado cocktail is both yummy and spicy (hot hot hot!). Walk over to Lamar and visit the large indie bookstore (Bookpeople) and Waterloo Records and just around the corner is the flagship Whole Foods store (and lots of great shopping).

Cozy and comfortable great surroundings nice area to walk around fabulous Austin restaurants actually within walking distance...just great! The cottage itself features a really comfortable bed very clean great areas for enjoying the outdoors for example a stone patio in a beautiful garden perfect for enjoying a glass of wine. We enjoyed the resident kitties hanging around happily outside as well as the entertaining chickens. Next time we will probably bring some breakfast things with us as the cozy kitchen is equipped with a small frig sink microwave dishes oven and cooktop. The hosts kindly leave some basics like bottled water some craft beer salsa and chips apple juice in the frig. It was truly a perfect stay.

The room itself was clean adequately supplied with bedding and towels a bit lacking in natural light -- good for sleeping. Dan was out of the country but his host was friendly easy to communicate with and easygoing.

(We stayed over the mardi gras weekend.) The unit is on 3rd floor in an apt/condo complex with secured gates. Location is very safe and convenient where there are great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Our self check-in was easy and had enough towels to use.

We loved drinking wine on the front porch at night with the beautiful view of the twinkly downtown skyline; grilling out back by the airstream with the French lighting overhead; the dark mahogany wood floors; the high quality sheets and big bed; the leather couch; all of the amenities like flatscreen TV surround sound etc.  Best of all East 6th was just a short walk and South Congress and downtown were a short bike ride away (we loved the bikes too!). Morning jogs by the lake added a nice touch. Morning coffee at Cenote cafe and lunch at Mr. Natural (I think we saw Matthew McConaughey there!).  The Western Art (by A. Kelly Pruitt) made the stay feel like the real Texas experience. Thanks for making it such a great stay.

224979,3558443,2/17/2013,Ryan,"My girlfriend and I wanted a few days in the warm weather of sunny Austin.  The cottage surpassed our expectations.  The welcome packet that Joe sent prior to the stay was very complete and informative.  Ranging from accessing the cottage to things available in the area from food to entertainment.  It was very useful to people like us who wanted to experience Austin but weren't sure where to begin.

The cottage itself was very clean and very well maintained.  During our 3 day stay each time we walked in to the place it smelled fresh and clean and felt like a home away from home.  The use of space was awesome and we couldn't help but appreciate it multiple times.

The neighborhood was very quiet and the bed was comfortable and the sleep peaceful.  We decided to stay and extra day but unfortunately the cottage was not available.  Joe's wife however was happy to recommended a few hotels in the area we could stay in and did what she could to see if any other cottages were available of Joe's.  We did end up meeting her on the morning we checked out and she was just as pleasurable in person as she was on the phone.

We can't speak highly enough of the cottage the stay and the professionalism we experienced.  The cottage is definitely recommended for long or short stays in Austin TX.  This is our first time using airBNB first time going to a BnB at all and first time interacting with Joe and it certainly will not be our last.  Austin was great and we will be back!

375142,3577032,2/18/2013,Lisa,A few weeks ago I took a look on Airbnb to find a clean room to stay for an upcoming workshop in Austin TX. I got a whole lot more than I ever expected. The place I found was just plain amazing. It was as clean and neat as any 5 star hotel but cooler than any boutique hotel anywhere. Full kitchen with everything I needed great balconies to take in the surroundings and the walls adorned with fascinating works of art. My bedroom was well appointed the linens and towels were luxurious and the place was like something out of a hip design magazine. I had this feeling that everything had some kind of story attached to it and after meeting my host I was right. This is one traveled person who has loves to entertain and be a host. And the house reflects that. Susan pays a lot of attention to the little details that make this such a great place to stay. And the location is about as good as it gets in Austin. I could walk to South Congress restaurants cafes and shops in no time. There is all the city bustle nearby yet this little pocket of Travis Heights is quiet and great for walking or biking. This small condo complex itself is inviting. I’ve also learned that it is possible to rent the entire unit as well. I will be booking this room again for my next weekend workshop in Austin as I loved staying in this well maintained home.. It is just infused with a great vibe.

The house is a quick easy drive to downtown but far enough away that it's really a peaceful area.   We never had a problem with traffic on our way downtown.  I know there was a bus stop nearby and I'm sure that would be an easy commute as well; we will have to try that mode of transportation next time.

The location was great and we didn't stay in very much but it would have been nice if the TV had worked downstairs or if there was something to do there.  There's also a person living there full time...so we felt like we were intruding on his turf a little bit.

Everything about the home seems a little better than the listing.  The location was absolutely prime for us walking to the start of the Austin Marathon and back home from the finish.  The bicycles came in really handy for the non-runners too.

76501,3592637,2/20/2013,Dan,"My adult daughter and I had a great time in Austin staying at Kevin's upstairs flat while in town to run the Austin Half Marathon. The flat is decorated in a funky Texas style and in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of the UT campus. There is plenty of parking space available and a backyard full of chickens (no roosters).

 The only negatives I could mention are that my daughter found the fold out sofa bed to not be very comfortable and the dining room table is very small. As the flat is on the second floor with a private entrance guests must be comfortable negotiating stairs to enter and exit.

We arrived to find a 6 pack of local beer in the fridge and Kevin keeps a fully stocked bar in the flat.

Overall I would highly recommend staying in Kevin's upstairs flat while visiting Austin.

The private backyard was our favorite place to hang out though since we all love being outside and could be protected by the overhang on the deck in any weather.

Julia was exceptionally responsive emailing back immediately with answers to all of our questions. I was very impressed by this especially since she was in Australia during our stay! She also has an electronic manual sent upon our confirmed reservation that was extremely helpful in regards to the apartment specifics Austin recommendations and transportation logistics.

About the apartment specifically: it is the perfect size for two people. (The couch folds down into a bed if you have a third person to accommodate.) The bed itself looks much smaller in the photos than it actually is in real life - we were both pleasantly surprised by the actual size and how comfortable it was! There are also several extra blankets/pillows which were nice to have. There is plenty of room in the closet and vanity area to stow away clothes suitcases etc. The appliances were all very nice and the iPod dock/television setup were nice touches. 

I think overall the apartment strikes a perfect balance between modern and personable. It was definitely one of the highlights for our stay in Austin.

We didn't rent a car and got by fine staying at Julia's. Many buslines going all over the city are only two blocks from the apartment (only $2 for a full day pass or $1 per ride). We also walked downtown a fair amount as it's only a 15-20 minute walk.

Lindsay wanted me to feel welcome and enjoy Austin; she was friendly easy to get in touch with offered tips on what to do and invited me to join her in activities. I appreciated the effort she made as a host she had snacks and coffee for me provided plenty of shampoo soap towels etc. Her place has wifi and netflix which is a nice touch. She even let me use her bike which was a much appreciated perk!

-great communication with the hosts and any issues were resolved in a timely manner
-the space is nice: 2 bedrooms bathroom living room kitchen and dining room
-great neighborhood: quiet bus stop across the street. We walked and biked most of the time
-off street parking was always available
-Always functioning wifi and cable
-nice running trail around the golf course 1/2 block away
Cons: 
-the living room furniture was not very functional for lounging. The couch was small and uncomfortable.
-no outlets in the bathroom
-the shower head was low with low water pressure. 
-we couldn't quite figure out the layout behind the bungalow but you do share the back wall/door with the hosts so it doesn't feel as private when you can hear the commotion and smell the cooking on the other side
-I don't know if it was just when we were guests but there was constant laundry going on which seemed to limit the hot water. The laundry room shares the wall with the kitchen

When I opened the door to Joe's cottage I immediately felt at home. Sweetly decorated comfortable fully equipped and relaxingly private this cottage is absolutely perfect. Joe provided great information prior to my arrival so I found the location easily and was impressed with the local amenities (especially Crow Bar on the corner - perfect for a nightcap). I was able to enjoy the many charms of SoCo while having easy access to the events downtown and I can't say how nice it was to escape the mayhem and come back at night to the little oasis with it's comfy bed plethora of pillows and full wifi/cable.

For example when I had trouble sleeping due to light coming in the windows at night she found and hung some temporary curtains which really helped (the shear curtains pictured in the bedrooms were not present; instead the windows had wooden blinds). However the home is in need of renovation. For example the linoleum in the main living area an hall is torn and worn in several spots and the kitchen and bathroom could definitely use an update. There is no dishwasher or microwave. One of the beds was very squeeky and kept us awake at night; we switched to the other bed. We enjoyed the large sliding glass doors during the day but at night the main living area was pretty dark. The baby enjoyed the nearby park and the cats were very comfortable.

It was kind of a last minute decision on my part so I was really lucky to have hit upon Kaleem's place on AirBNB . My stay was really comfortable and wonderful in all aspects. Kaleem went out of his way to make sure I could come in anytime even staying up late to receive me the first day as SXSW events can go pretty late sometimes. Upon my request he installed additional fixtures such as locks to my individual room as well. Most importantly I found Kaleem to be a great guy to be around. I would recommend this room to my friends as well who are visiting Austin or to anyone looking for a comfortable quiet and friendly place to stay in Austin.,ACL Room 2!,2744498,Kaleem

The place itself is great.   I was a bit worried that it would be too far away when at SXSW and while it's not a block away the walk is easy 10 - 15 mins.  Also there is a free laundry in her building 2 doors away so that's nice to have when travelling

Carson went out of his way to drive me to the food trucks for lunch (I didn't get to Austin until 2:30pm and I was starving) then drop me off at downtown where I was supposed to meet my friends.  Veronica gave me really good tips on breakfast places around Austin.  Though I spent my entire week at SXSW so I didn't see them much during my stay.  And make sure to say hi to their fluffy dog Chef who will jump up and lick you face!  : )  They also have two cute but shy cats.

Location-wise: this place is safe even at night though it is residential so very quiet. It is about 10-15 min walk to the bus stop to downtown and the buses comes only in 20-30min intervals so make sure you budget your time.  During big festivals (like SXSW) after midnight some cabs will refuse to take you to this area since they can't get a return fare back - which pissed me off but nothing much I can do (I show them the map on my phone) so bear this in mind.  

But seriously you can't get a better deal in Austin during SXSW!  : )

I was in town for SXSW so things were a little more hectic than usual in Austin. Location-wise this was not my first choice to stay only because I would have preferred being able to walk bike or take public transit more easily but given the event and how crazy prices get I was really excited to come across Colette's place - it's only about 3.5-4 miles from downtown. For the most part cabs came within 10 minutes of calling but there were a couple of times where I felt a little stranded because I had to wait so long (but keep in mind that it was SXSW!).

Colette was a really great host - especially given that I had the honor of being her first airbnb guest.  We spoke on the phone before I arrived and emailed/texted a few times. She left notes around the house for me and let me borrow things like her hair dryer.

I was the only one staying here and her place could have comfortably accommodated a group of 3-4. I would recommend Colette's place as a place to stay but would suggest renting a car (when being in town for a huge event like SXSW) to get around - she has plenty of parking.

Also she mentions this in her description but she does have a cat (who only stayed outside when I was staying there). So if you have cat allergies or don't like cats this is not the place for you. I left a bowl of food & water for the cat each morning of my stay (which Colette and I had worked out before I arrived).",Bentwood Bungalow-ACL / F1 / SXSW +,3608082,Colette

Comments:
- This room is not a ""room"" is an small attic. The bed is ok. But you cannot be standing there. Getting your clothes on and off from a bag takes a little bit of effort.
- If you carry a medium / big bag it´s hard to move it up there and there´s no enough space in the attic for a medium/big bag
- If you are not a doggy person...Gray´s dogs are extremely friendly. Extremely... they´ll come to you all the time. They might get into the house around 8 AM for breakfast so be prepared to hear them playing around.
- Getting up and down of the attic must be done carefully. It´s a steep climb to the attic for non-athletic people.
- The place is perfect if you´re attending to the convention center or downtown.
- The house is a quite place to stay

337149,3786785,3/15/2013,Rachel,"In most ways this place came as advertised. Jessica was nice and helpful in initially getting the keys to us quickly and easily. There were a couple things that weren't ideal for our group though. The place is really cute--it looks exactly like the pictures--but there were some oddities. There's no microwave in the house and none of the bedrooms have full-length mirrors. (There is one full-length mirror but it's in the living room.) The other big thing was location. We came out to attend SXSW and wanted something which was a very short walk to the Austin Convention Center. This place is a 20 minute walk there not a 10 minute walk. (Maybe ""downtown"" isn't defined as the area in/around the Convention Center though it certainly seems that way.) The area the house is in is adorable--as a bonus it's close to a number of very cool bars--but it was just further from where we needed to be than we expected. 
The other issue is that while the house comfortably sleeps six in two full bedrooms and a loft it only has one full bathroom. And because this bathroom shares a wall with each of the downstairs bedrooms it offers even less privacy. (Basically when you're in either of the downstairs bedrooms you can hear everything happening in the bathroom.)
While this house wound up posing some disappointments for our group--a group of colleagues in Austin expressly for SXSW--I think it's a great place for a couple who wants to visit the city for fun.

758470,3788464,3/15/2013,Ray,Friday February 1 I paid Airbnb $956 for a three night  accommodation March 11 12 & 13. Sunday March 10 at 3:30PM Matt Schram called to inform me that the room I rented from him was not available the first night. He said he was trying to accommodate everyone for SXSW  and needed to move me to a smaller room. He said he would give me a cash refund. The room I got was a converted pantry and closet with a full size bed. Matt said that the best time to move to the large suite I paid for would be 2PM Tuesday March 12. I arranged my schedule to work with that. I was out early for a meeting and came back to take a nap and shower at 12:50PM. There were no pillowcases or sheets on the bed no towels in the bathroom. Therefore no nap or shower for me. At 2PM when I went to move to the room I originally rented. It was not yet cleaned. The cleaning lady was in the room and her daughter was napping on the couch. At 2:40PM she came out and told me the room was ready for me. The room turned out to be Matt's own bedroom/office which he still felt free to use although he rented it to me. I have rented many rooms and stayed in many B&B's in my travels for years. I have never run across a situation where the owner has someone rent his own personal room while he stays in the building. The room was filled with Matt's things. The closets and dressers were all full. There was no where to hang clothes. It was strange and uncomfortable to say the least. There were no shades on the window at the head of the bed no towels in the bathroom.  When I was in the room Tuesday March 12 at 4PM taking a nap Matt unlocked the door and entered the room. He did not knock. He said he needed to get some shampoo and get cleaned up. Was he going to use my shower?  I guess he still felt it was his shower and room to use freely although I paid Airbnb $956 for it. He came into the room and got something from the bathroom. I felt so uncomfortable and cheated at this point that I gathered my stuff left the house and found other accommodations. Matt showed no regard for privacy schedule space. There was continuous construction in the house broken refrigerator dog hair covered couches. I have had no response from Matt and I have received no refund of any kind. For $956 I spent one night in a room that was much smaller than the one for which I paid.

As an entertainment attorney on business at SXSW I was up at dawn and back late at night. I was sure that my routine would create consternation in my host! On the contrary Jenn was totally understanding and accommodating. In fact she even supplied me with new pillows and sheets for my room to make me feel welcome and was always available to me by phone or text. As a result my stay was one of the best I've had at SXSW!

We were three colleagues who stayed for almost 10 days during SXSW. We each had our own room using the luxury air mattress as a third bedroom. Everything was in place and in order when we arrived as was a case of beers in the fridge. Much appreciated! The sheets were very comfortable the two bathrooms were great. There is a back porch with a bbq and seating for evening meals in the open.

Importantly the location is excellent. Only a block away from South Congress a great place for diners and restaurants. We rented bikes which were great only about 10-15mins (downhill) into downtown Austin were all the events at SXSW was. About 20-25 mins going back up (depending on your condition and how much fun you had that night). Alternatively taxis are about 10 dollars.

Jennifer and her boyfriend made us feel like home. Even better. She took care of everything she even drove us to the SXSW Festival. I loved sitting and chatting on the stairs of the garden listening to the birds singing singing a song for her. 
The house is very special and full of details. The room is very cozy and beautiful you want to stand for hours under the shower (what I of course not did for eviromental reasons ;)). 
There is a bus that brings you downtown just some blocks away. The neighbourhood is quiet and very Texas like. 
The house is an artpiece itself. 
In the ""living room"" there is a stage where events could happen. As well as a photoshoot this place would be very unique. Just contact Jennifer if you are getting inspired by the house as I did. 
Jennifer has many interesting  friends so if you want to hang out with the cool Austin crowd need a massage or a private Yoga lesson Jennifer might share some contacts with you. 
If you don´t like animals that are supercute and if you don´t like a host who is the best host I ever met in my whole Airbnb career then this is not the place for you. 
If you want to experience the whole Airbnb experience then I am quite sure Jennifer will welcome you with open arms. 

After that stay I am calling Jennifer a friend. 
Thank you for everything.

I was attending SXSW and was rather busy most days and nights and just needed somewhere safe and reliable to rest my head each night which is exactly what it was. Dan was very hospitable and full of local info. He was great for a chat or happy to leave you to do your own thing. 

The room was exactly how I thought it would be from the pictures. The Foton was very comfortable and the room could be either opened up to let the morning light in or easily darken for a sleep in (which I did a lot). The room even cam with a complimentary mini bar which I thought was a really nice touch.

Shops and basic necessities were no more the then 10 min walk away. The heart of South Congress was about 15 min walk and downtown was 30 mins walk or $10 taxi. There was a bus stop close by but I didn't use it.

52874,3812782,3/18/2013,Freya,"Having Jill's studio as a base for a calm SXSW (in the company of my 4 year old) was just perfect. The space is very charming and has everything you might need: a kitchenette a lovely bathroom with a bath tub and of course the outdoors shower that we loved! Sleeping out on the screen porch was great - now one of my goals in life is to live somewhere where i can sleep on a screen porch and listen to the birds waking up in the morning!! Beautiful!
Jill provided stuff in the fridge for us: milk bagels juice beer etc. - so sweet and thoughtful and extremely helpful when we woke up the first morning when we had gotten in from europe really late the previous night. She and her kids also provided fresh towels and bed linen from time to time. They were very hospitable and had loads of tips for the area and Austin in general.
My son thoroughly enjoyed the Big Stacy pool which is just a short stroll from Jill's place - a year-round free public swimming pool which is really well taken care of. And in general we loved the neighborhood very much - SoCo is the place to be in Austin it seems! Good restaurants and fun shopping right around the corner and still the house feels like a calm oasis. Plus it's quite close to downtown. 
So to sum it up: we loved it here and would not hesitate to visit again. And I'd definitely recommend staying here to anyone... beats staying at a hotel by many many miles!

This location was good for east side venues and only a 30-40 minute walk to the main 6th street venues. There was an easily accessible grocery store food options and transportation nearby. The host was immediately available if we had any concerns (which we didn't) and brought extra blankets and pillows for our large group. Admittedly we had to share beds and bring an extra air mattress to squeeze in ten people so anyone staying with more than eight people should understand that. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. ,3BR/2BA Rooftop Deck East Downtown,1642082,Christian

Also had access to wi-fi which I had no issue with what so ever (way quicker than Australian wi-fi actually).

We were in Austin for SXSW and this was the perfect accommodation for the event far enough out of town to be quiet at night while still being close enough to the action. (About a 25 minute walk or incredibly quick cab ride)

Jason was welcoming and accommodating being nice enough to leave a bottle of wine and some beer in the fridge before giving us plenty of privacy during the festival.  When a member of a group left her camera behind he was helpful in mailing it to us!

The location is even better than advertised sleeping 4 more than comfortably and could probably accommodate 5 easily (especially with the 2 full bathrooms). Nathan was extremely understanding when our flight was delayed substantially and was there waiting for us. He also went the extra mile by cutting extra keys so we all could have one! Not to mention left us treats that came in handy after all of the travelling. There was a small music stage out front and food trucks for easy food but the Hillside Farmacy literally across the street was one of the best places to eat. Definite must for breakfast or lunch. I only wish we had been there on a normal week so we would actually take the time to wait at Franklin's BBQ which is only a few blocks away and arguably the best BBQ in Austin! Maybe next time.

Their home is a little slice of paradise. It's spacious open and clean. The backyard was our favourite part. The pictures don't do the large very relaxing patio justice. We also found it pretty novel that they have a chicken coop and took a few eggs to fry up during our big band-family dinner/BBQ. We also made use of their backyard fire pit which was a perfect way to wind down after a long day. Their absolutely lovely house cat Lola was very friendly and actually made the stay even more enjoyable. 

Not only was the house great but you couldn't ask for better hosts. They left thorough instructions and recommendations for local eateries and invited us to help ourselves to the food and beer in the fridge (which we definitely did :)).

The house is about a 40 minute walk from downtown but that's really not all that bad since during SX you usually leave in the morning and don't come back until the evening. We usually walked in a group down 11th ave home every night or caught a cab (which ran us under $10 total for a trip from downtown).

It's a 10 minute walk to the middle of everything. And there are bikes as well!!! My everyday ride to the Convention Center would take less than 5 minutes!!! The house is situated at a very calm neighbourhood.  The street has an amazing sun light. I took tons of pictures outside! But what my instagram followers were dying was the inside of the house. Bedrooms are big bedsheets are fresh rich and new. Bathroom is shared. It stays between the two big bedrooms. Everything is new! Kitchen is large with every appliance you can think of. (And actually a few I've never seen before). Digital washing and drying machines make life so easy. Talking about easy life: the backyard!!!! It's amaaaazing. The best sun light a large table comfortable chairs in every corner a hammock in the shadow and...AN AIRSTREAM!!!! The AIRSTREAM is an experience at its own. It's so cool. People would come visit us to see the airstream. Its been remodeled inside so two people can fit perfectly. Or as we did one can feel like a beatnik writer sipping some wine while lessoning good jazz and the trees outside. 
Oh something else: there's garage so organized and with so many tools that Steve Jobs could've started Apple over there. 
Also fast wifi and a great printer that comes handy if you need it!

Simon and his wife are kind gracious responsive witty and easy going and we enjoyed several warm conversations during our visit. The place was large and spotlessly clean with a well-furnished kitchen for cooking and skylights that keep the living space bright and airy. Simon even left us a complimentary six pack of Modelos chips and salsa and a couple slices of pie when we arrived----a great welcome to kick off a wonderful SXSW adventure. We were saddened to have to leave and can't wait to come back. ,Southwestern Adobe Guest House,10615,Simon

We love her style of decorating and were ever so happy we chose her place as we had lots of paperwork to do (including tax returns!) and no place could have been as nice for spending our days cooped up inside catching up.  We should note that had we been intent on touring Austin - it is a drive to get up to the city center.  However we found enough restaurants and shops nearby for what we needed so the location was not a big issue for us.

324552,3860024,3/22/2013,Lindsey,Matt was a good host - flexible and friendly - and his house is beautiful. Best of all it's in a fantastic location just behind Magnolia on South Congress. We stayed both in the main house (in the gorgeous high-ceilinged master suite complete with balcony - thanks Matt!) and then in the separate studio out in the backyard. The master suite is lovely and Matt managed to accommodate us there after a double booking which meant there wasn't room for us in the room downstairs I'd originally booked. Later in the week when my friends left I moved to Matt's separate studio for a few days. I preferred the studio for its privacy and self-sufficiency and spent happy hours on the sunny roof terrace above. The wifi is speedy the beds are comfy and when the sun's out the yard is a great place to hang out. The dog and cats are very sweet too. The studio's contents are basic (bring your own washing up liquid kitchen cloth cutlery...) but perhaps its intended for people who mostly eat out. If the weather is bad I think you'd get stir-crazy pretty quickly as it's not a huge space (it has a bed and kitchen table/chairs but not a sofa) and there isn't a huge amount of natural light. But it was ideal for me on my own both working on my laptop and hanging out on vacation and I wouldn't hesitate to come back. Thanks Matt!  ,South Congress private SOCO Studio ,1348968,SoCoBnB /Matt

Warm atmosphere well-decorated very nicely appointed high quality appliances fabulous location and neighborhood ... these are other words that describe the house.
This was my first Airbnb experience and I was not expecting such a high degree of comfort and delight. Sara is an extremely well organized and thoughtful host.  Instructions and guidelines for guests are concise clear and welcoming in tone.
We tried to meet in person the three days  I was there but our schedules made that impossible. Still she and I kept in touch through frequent texts. Without going into detail I will tell you that when she says she is reachable at all hours of the day or night if you need her she is telling the truth!

The Living room is spacious it has a nice couch and some chairs an old wooden chest as a coffee table (please use coasters or some kind of protection from cups) fireplace and a built in speaker system. 
The best part is that it looks out to an outdoor screened patio eating area and of course the large deck that wraps around the entire side and rear of the house.  It has a really nice rear yard which has several levels of grass and steps.  
Between the combination of the elevated deck and the ground level naturally beginning to slope down after the rear yard ends when you step out of the living room through the beautifully stained hardwood sliding doors you are immediately taken by the magnificent wide open view of trees sun nature wilderness and the edge of Zilker Park and beyond.  It was such a pleasure to sit relax drink  and enjoy the view from the deck.   It most certainly has a tree house feel as described. 
There was a carport that covered our rented bikes and a driveway which easily fit the suburban we rented.  The house is situated in the heart of zilker a beautiful neighborhood literally walking distance to the parks Barton springs and minutes from downtown and every other area Austin is known for.  
Michael and Shanti were great I only saw them when I arrived and then when I left but were available if we needed anything. If you want to come and enjoy all of what Austin has to offer I seriously recommend this house it serves as a great home base for whatever you have planned.

I confess that I was nervous about staying in staying in someone's home but Peggy was a very warm and gracious hostess and put me right at ease. My room was comfortable and as pictured. The air mattress was very comfy - quite sturdy and firm. I was there for a week and relied on frozen meals but there was plenty of freezer space and access to the kitchen was no problem. Peggy made it easy to navigate her kitchen as she's labeled the cabinets and drawers which I thought was clever. The bathroom was shared but I was always able to use it whenever I wanted without waiting and there were plenty of towels on hand. I was able to use the washer/dryer which I thought was a very nice perk. All in all a very comfortable stay! If I have to go back to Austin I would definitely try to stay with Peggy again. ,Office bedrm with private entrance ,1631335,Peggy

The location is only a couple miles drive to downtown where parking is easily available.  The lakefront is nice although the weather was a bit cool so we didn't spend any time there or in the pool.
The queen bed is great --a posturepedic and very comfortable after running all day long.  The condo is not fancy but very adequate with a full kitchen large dining/family room area and a nice wall-mounted flat screen TV.  The bathroom is adequate but not large with a bath/shower and nice light above the mirror at the sink.  Towels are provided.
The airport is relatively close which worked for us.  The condo is in an area that is improving with a fair amount of construction underway which seems to be the case throughout Austin.  Parking is secure via code key entry.  Stay off the freeway during rush hour -- it's packed.
Dave was great accommodating our late arrival on Sunday night.  We'd definitely stay here again.

We adored the cozy bed that made relaxation instantaneous as well as the cool couch where naps could materialize. Everything was spotless modern and really cool down to the coffee maker and fridge. The snacks and drinks such as granola beer and fruit juice greeted us after a long journey and quenched our taste buds immediately. Really this was an ideal place to stay.

Seasha and I really hit it off and it felt way more like a slumber party than renting a room. They are both interesting smart and helpful. John is a bit more quiet and really goes out of his way to try and meet guest needs. Seasha is feisty colorful and involved in a fascinating art project at Burning Man. She is a great cook and was not a ""burning woman"". She did NOT burn the amazing chocolate chocolate chip cookies that I ate three of. If you like to meet people when you travel especially if you are from abroad and want an authentic and memorable Austin experience this is an ideal place to stay. They gave me lots of tips on places to eat and things to do and Seasha spent about an hour making a map and printing it out showing the location of everything I was interested in. Wow! However John and Seasha left me totally alone when I closed the door to my room so I am sure guests who prefer autonomy and privacy will get what they need.

There were 8 of us staying and there was plenty of room for us all. The house was clean and welcoming and we were quickly able to settle into the place. Communication prior to the visit was excellent Aaron was easy to reach and and made sure we had all the information we needed. We loved the hammocks and the trampoline and were only sorry that we didn't get to spend much time at the house enjoying these outdoor facilities. It was a relaxed place to stay and in a very convenient situation for us. The late night train noises were a surprise on the first night but we quickly got used to them.

I made the attempt on multiple occasions to reach out and try to resolve a refund or credit with this host to no avail.  I also made multiple attempts to resolve with airbnb and was told I would have to notify the host directly for her to lift her ""strict"" cancellation policy.  (Which she did not)  I have now gone back and forth with both for a month with no resolution. It was very disappointing to be out nearly $400 due to an extenuating circumstance that could not be helped.  I understand hosts need to keep their rentals occupied but I notified her directly several days before of the situation.  At the time I thought she was genuinely concerned but I was wrong.  I feel like anyone with a conscious or kids would have been kind enough to at least offer to reschedule our dates.

First off i saved over $180 to rent this home over hotel rooms.
Second this home provided us much more room and comfort for the family.
The pictures are accurate and the host / owner   Joseph is very nice and will help in any way.   There was one step that my daughters wheelchair needed to go over  and he happily provided a plank that worked very well to allow her easy access into the home.

Most of the other attendees were in a hotel nearly a mile away from the event. This is a central location and within walking distance of most places you would want to visit.

The loft itself was pretty good. That big bed upstairs was amazing and I slept great. There's a second bed downstairs my roommate enjoyed with comfort. There are a few interesting noises you'll hear late at night/early in the morning like a train whistle or the occasional car driving by but it's mostly pretty quiet.

There was only one incident that happened on the final night of my visit. I heard a gnawing sound downstairs around 5AM and went to investigate. When I didn't see anything I tried going back upstairs to sleep but was again awakened by the gnawing sound. When I went back downstairs I could see where a mouse had gotten on top of the refrigerator and thrown down on my almond butter and dark chocolate. EWWWW!

To her credit Veronica did email me to apologize and asked what she could do. She is getting an electronic mouse exterminator thingy installed in the rooms. I didn't get much sleep that last night (about 4 hours) and the cost of the food I lost to the rodent was about $15.

She introduced me to her family and her pets. She also made sure that I can ask her for anything I needed. I was in and out all week I got a bit chance getting to know her as she is extremely nice. 

The airstream is located in the backyard in a relaxing setting with chairs to spend time sitting and relaxing. I didn't have a chance to do so. The airstream is also very comfortable and fresh smelling inside. It is a perfect place to have downtime upon arrival after such a busy day traveling all day. A long desk to read and eat a comfortable futon to relax and reflect with the soft lights all around. The bathroom is cute with the soft light bulbs which is equally relaxing. I was informed by Marcella that hot water in the shower usually runs for a short time. I had no problem as I finished using it every time before it becomes cold. Hot water at the sink doesn't run out and is available when needed. Marcella made sure everything is comfortable for me by checking on me and giving suggestions in the notebook about places in Austin to glass jar full of water and a jar of homemade toffee. I couldn't get enough of toffee as they were so delicious! I bought several bags of them from her website to take home.

The wall-unit air conditioner in the bedroom is pretty noisy at night we had to turn it off to keep from waking up every 20 mins. 

 The place is fine and if you need to save a few bucks on lodging in Austin it will definitely give you a nice place to serve as home base.",Guest Villa 2 Miles To D/T,1151576,Joe & Bella

When I arrived from the airport candles were all lit there was water in a crystal carafe beside the bed and all the wifi that I needed :)  The master bed/bath is exquisite all in rich tones of deep red gold black -- filled with soothing creature comforts.

Their location is amazing a must-stay if you love animals.. a friendly old dog who quickly became a close pal a tiny little pet pig a tortoise out back along with a very large iguana some chickens some ducks some peacocks... 

One warning: if you post pictures of your stay your friends will probably grow jealous. Especially of the wonderful animals. I got several remarks along those lines -- one friend who works remotely and travels a lot even considered moving there for a few months.

I had a little spare time on one of the mornings so I used the French press in the kitchen to brew a fine dark roast then sprawled on their guest couch (which ""seats"" approx a dozen adults in comfort) with my laptop to write another chapter for an upcoming book.

83322,4003907,4/2/2013,Kim,Spent a long weekend @ Melissa & Bill's place. It really was perfect for what we were looking for! The hosts were available but not intrusive the neighborhood was quiet but still close to all retail & food needs and there is even decent hiking trails that get you to the greenbelt without needing to drive anywhere! The loft had everything we needed (even an ironing board & iron). The bath tub is big enough for two & the shower head is high enough that I didn't have to hunch over to wash my hair. The dogs are big & very gentle. Really - everything was as they presented it. Bill even went out of his way to make sure we had the latest weekly magazines with local eatery reviews since he knew we wanted to dine out quite a bit. This is a beautiful well kept quiet space with plenty of privacy or social options. Give it a shot!,Loft on Cupid's Bluff,454099,Melissa & Bill

The location is excellent the property is beautiful and the guest house is well appointed and spacious. Gretchen is very cool and easy going but is on the ball when she needs to be- she warned me well in advance of some unavoidable inspectors coming to look at something the next day (which didn't interfere anyway I was out). This is a perfect location if you're renting bikes like I did since it's just a few minutes ride to South Congress about 10 minutes to 6th street and 15-20 to the east side all while being tucked away and quiet.

892618,4022005,4/3/2013,Julie,I'm hesitant to let anyone know how fantastic my 86 year old mother and I found Georgia's place since I want to go there again and I want it to be available when I try and book it. From the outside it looks like a plain Jane house but inside it has been lovingly renovated and has fun original and stylish decor with many vintage finds enlivening the atmosphere. (Great idea to upholster office chairs with vintage fabric and use them at a breakfast table!) The place has many little luxuries like granite counter tops a big flat screen TV and a super shower head and it is spotlessly clean and well appointed. The linen closet with rolled towels and toiletries is a wonder to behold! There was white wine and frosty chilled glasses in the fridge red wine chips and salsa on the sideboard and a really nice well appointed  kitchen that we enjoyed cooking breakfast in. There were all sorts of nice soaps creams and shampoos even soap with a hole in it (to avoid leftover soap slivers) which I had never seen. Georgia thoughtfully included a hangover kit which we were happy not to need and polar fleece blankets on the backs of the outdoor chairs. When she heard that I was a light sleeper she left off a sleep/ambient noise machine and extra earplugs. (There were some in the hangover kit too.) She also came by to take a rental wheelchair we had dropped off inside. The beds were really good- newer pillow top mattresses with nice bedding. If you like my elderly Mom like hard beds the twin bed in one room and the sofas are harder. If you are in a group the living room doors close so you actually could use this as a four bedroom. There are two sofas and a room with two beds so this place would sleep 6 without sharing a bed or sleeping on the floor. I'm hoping to return and get a bunch of girlfriends to rent the house together. I would REALLY like to run away for home and live in this house just the way it is PERMANENTLY. Alas I only had two nights in this wonderful place. I would at least like Georgia to come decorate MY house. The only downside is that there is traffic noise from a major highway about a block away. There are chickens and outdoor cats in the neighborhood as well. None of this should bother you because there is central AC and you can have the windows shut at night. I used the sleep/noise machine and slept beautifully and my Mom slept fine without it.,Comfortable home close to Downtown,3475096,Georgia

The living space and small kitchen is extraordinarily efficient delightfully modern and had everything we needed.  We even loved the packs of maple oatmeal and espresso options the hosts had ready for us.  Access and parking was very convenient.  Our children enjoyed the space inside and outside surroundings very much but we had to be mindful of our youngest daughter occasionally trying to escape up the loft ladder (easily closed off by a door so it wasn't a big problem).  This was my first experience booking through AirBnB and I couldn't be more pleased.  I highly recommend it for a great way to enjoy Austin!,Chic Hyde Park Casita,5037631,Mark & Monica

The location just can't be beat and everything is within walking distance so there is really no need to have a car and there are a ton of bars and restaurants in the neighborhood.  From the airport we decided to take the shuttle bus into downtown which only costed us $1 each took 20 minutes  and dropped us off about 2 blocks from the apartment.  The apartment also offers great views of the Capital building which is nice.  The apartment was very clean which is important for us.  Also the convenience of being able to walk outside in the matter of seconds is priceless no waiting for elevators or going up flights and flights of stairs.  Jacob was a great host and was more than responsive.  He was able to answer all of my questions in a timely manner and I still had a few questions for him when I arrived at the apartment such as the internet password.  Overall Jacob couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.  The keyless entry is great and easy too.

If you are young and enjoy the bar scene then maybe this will work for you.  The toilet ran all night and we were concerned about leaving the rental car out in the neighbourhood.  There is no outside light so it was a bit difficult to get the key in the door at night. There is no television or radio. On a positive side the beds were really comfortable and Andi left some refreshments in the fridge which we really appreciated.

I felt very welcome and very safe here - which is not always easy for a single woman to find when traveling alone.  Coleman made me feel right at home and although I didn't spend a lot of time with him what little time I did spend led me to believe Coleman is truly one-of-a-kind.  Eco-conscious helpful intelligent resourceful talented (you MUST see his wooden bowls) and generous (I found a book on his bookshelf that I LOVED and he quickly replied ""just take it"").  

When I had questions about Austin he was very helpful answering them and he also let me use one of his bikes all weekend - which was great!

And this is just a personal preference but I am a sucker for a good warm shower.  In the most ridiculous of traveling situations (and I've been in a lot hahahaha) - all I really want is a long hot shower.  And when you're traveling you never really know what you're gonna get.  But if you stay here you'll have no worries in that department.  I had three hot amazing shower experiences at the Eco Nature Retreat (the shower has a window looking out into the trees...).  And the warm water never ran out.

He went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Dan was a great resource with information about his neighborhood and Austin in general. Dan's home is in an excellent location in the very desirable south Austin neighborhood known by its zip code - 78704. The home is within a 5-to-15 minute drive from everywhere a tourist or visitor will want to go which is very important in Austin. The home has easy access to two major north/south streets - Lamar and Congress - plus three major east/west streets - Oltorf Riverside and Cesar Chavez. These streets provide easy access to downtown and central Austin plus convenient access to major freeways including Mopac (Rt.1) Interstate 35 and the Ben White Expressway (Rt. 71.)

We did not spend much time apart from sleeping in the room anyway- so it was excellent! If we stayed longer we would have gone for a bigger room but for 1 night it was just right.

Although it has two beds it would not be comfortable for two couples to stay because one bed is in a room shared with the living room (has no door or wall).  It was great for a family with younger more flexible kids because the second bed is a blow up and not solid for those with bad backs. Overall the place was great. Such an amazing location quiet and safe. I went on many runs in the area and found that there was much to explore there in Zilker. She has the most unique decorations and makes you feel at home. If all you want to do is read don't worry- she has plenty of magazines and every best seller ever sold. The kitchen is very small but has all the amenities except a microwave. There is no kitchen table but there is a lovely deck for the condo building with a patio table for dining. She welcomed us with a bottle of champagne and plenty of beer! The bathroom was nice but it is in the bedroom and therefore access for night bathroomers is challenging. Internet is fast and TV was great.

We needed a place that could accommodate athletes. This was the place! Aaron the owner was very quick to respond to all inquiries. Had everything in place on time. The house was neat and clean. Loads of sports stuff on site: bikes; a trampoline; PFDs which we needed for the boats. Hammocks. It was just what we needed and so close to Deep Eddy you could ride a bike or walk. 

We are likely to return. I have only one observation which is not a negative. It is well-suited for active visitors.

It's so secluded and beautiful yet only 10-15 minutes to the City to grab dinner and hit up farmers markets.  The cabin was meticulously clean and the decor and layout was very relaxing.  Having morning coffee and afternoon beers on the back porch overlooking the hill of Oak trees and roaming cattle was absolutely wonderful.  Having a fully equipped kitchen was fantastic for making breakfast- especially since the kitchen was actually bigger than the one we have at home!  :)  The loft bed was comfortable and cozy but my sneezing fits make me think the pillows were made of a feather/down blend (so if you're allergic be sure to bring an alternative).  Plenty of storage and a nice full shower- better than most local hotels.  The only thing missing was a radio or iPod player.. but thank goodness we had an old 8track radio in the trunk of the car since it made the porch sitting a little more entertaining.

It's clear that a lot of thought was put into making the Spartanette a good comfortable place to stay as opposed to just being slapped together on the cheap in order to make a quick buck on tourists.  Sara our host was very hospitable and was able to provide some good local knowledge and recommendations.  The property is great; the Spartanette is located in a very large backyard and the neighborhood is very quiet at night.  That combined with a super comfy bed in the Spartanette = good sleeping.  Everything was as described on airbnb; there were no unpleasant surprises.  I'd highly recommend the Spartanette as a very ""Austin"" place to stay - and way more interesting and charming than a typical bland hotel room.  It made the trip that much more memorable and unique (in a good way!).  Don't hesitate to book a stay here.",Chic 1953 Spartanette Guesthouse,1647037,Sara

The main room was a bit tight for four people but it worked Hosts were very responsive overall.  BUT - The only way to lock the door from either the inside or out was with a key.  DANGEROUS in emergencies and inconvenient at best since there weren't enough keys for each of our party to have one.  A bat got in through the loft vent on the 2nd night there and all hell broke loose.  Owner is a good person and will probably fix the lock issue but I'd make sure before I committed to staying there.,4th St Loft in Downtown Austin!,1654178,Erik & Crystal

It's a perfect location for exploring the hip East side of Austin and is about a 15 minute walk to all the good stuff in downtown and on 6th street. There's no shortage of things to do in the immediate area though and its proximity to Franklin BBQ (about 5 minutes away go early and get in line!) is a plus. Cindy was a great host and was always available if we had questions. The one small issue was the bikes. There are technically 5 bikes but only 3 of them are functional. With a group of 4 people we had to abandon plans to bike around but for a smaller group it wouldn't be a problem.

My client asked me to extend my engagement twice and I requested extending my reservation with AirBnB and Lupe twice.   Lupe approved my request each time making my visit much easier than if I had to change lodging.

Her loft is in a great location near downtown Austin and U of T.  It's very secure with a secured parking lot.  There is a terrific coffee shop right next door which was very convenient.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was quite generous in size.

There were only one minor thing I would change about my stay:
The ceiling fan would only run at the highest speed which was pretty noisy.  It was fairly hot while I was there.  However in Lupe's defense ...

I would have been quite comfortable had I been more diligent in reading Lupe's email the day I checked in which clearly stated ""Please feel free to adjust the temperature (located in the kitchen left wall)"".  Then the fan would not have been an issue.

Other than this one very minor issue (based on my own negligence rather than any fault of Lupe's) my stay was terrific.  I would happily stay there again.",Downtown East Austin Loft1bd/1bth ,3827537,Guadalupe

Even took advantage of the roof top deck to get some Texas tanning in can't do that in San Francisco much. Great TexMex is literally walking distance.

She also provides a 30-item list of places to eat city attractions and practical tips which led me and my gentleman caller straight to some of the best barbeque we've ever had (thanks Sovay!). This place was an excellent home base for me and said gentleman caller when we were visiting Austin and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay near the center of Austin. It's less than ten minutes from South Congress and downtown. The only cons are parking-related: there's just one parking space for Bungalow guests so if you have multiple cars be prepared to park five or so minutes away in the residential area. And the parking lot at Salon Sovay is extremely small and cramped and awkward to back out of since it's on a fairly busy street.

It was nice bc we took my son to the park which was a block over from the house. The house was close to everything. We went to dinner at parkside (seafood restaurant) downtown which was excellent. We also went to zilker park and took my son on the train ride which he loved. I luv Austin every time we come it has so much to offer.,East Austin 3 BR Near Downtown,2852262,Kate

My one gripe would be the bed that wasn't adorned with the the comfiest of pillows. I'm probably just a pillow snob but it was definitely tolerable. Also toiletries were not included but Daniel provided us with shampoo and conditioner whenever I asked him about it.

The house is total bachelor pad fun and the roof is the place to be to enjoy Lone Star and sun. Lone Star is perfect drinking for warm weather I've gotta find some in Chicago. House would be perfect for 3 couples as there are 3 bedrooms.

Although there were a few hiccups (cleaning person ran a little late hot tub was moved which created some power loss) Lois was communicative and none of the issues caused us any headaches. When I go to Austin again I am DEFINITELY staying with Lois. You should too.,Zilker Park Fun Funky Peaceful,272156,Lois

And the adults in the group had a blast being so close to town! Food truck village a few blocks away made for some excellent post-6th Street eating :) Joey was a great host; there when you needed things but not intrusive at all. The accommodations were super clean and very nice. Our daughter was sad to leave ""Mr Joey's house"" and talks about our weekend still. We had three adults and one toddler and fit very well. I'd recommend ""Mr Joey's house"" to anyone wanting a quiet super clean and very cute place close to all that Austin has to offer.

The house is a great place to stay and our group of nine had enough room to be comfortable! The neighborhood is really safe quiet close to downtown and the water. The house has a lot to offer for active people. We ended up renting the mopeds for the weekend which was a lot of fun cruising around the city. I wish we could have used all the other things the house has to offer but we were there for MotoGP so did not have time to enjoy everything the house had to offer!

I was able to come and go at any time (that was one of my concerns for one of these places) cab rides from here to downtown are $12-13/ about 10-15 minutes ride.  Their dogs are very playful and friendly but they have their own section in the house if you're not into cute lil pups coming up to greet you.  I'm not sure if this is all year-round but they have a set of christmas lights on the porch so that you can find your way back to the house easily that was very useful.

And Matt was as helpful as can be when I needed it and made me feel at home in his home. Matt even found a room for an extended stay for a friend of mine who was visiting Austin while looking for an apartment there.  

This home has several rooms available and I had some great conversations with other people traveling solo.

He offered me an upgrade which I took after seeing the room. Great space comfy bed soft sheets. There was even a chocolate on the pillow.

Coleman went over the functionality of the place and built a fire in the stove for me. Unusually for the time of year but well needed in the morning!

104386,4304330,4/26/2013,Teri,"Mary's little yellow cottage was an ideal spot to start our vacation. My wife her mum and I landed in Austin late in the evening but when the taxi delivered us to Mary's place we instantly felt at home in her clean! tidy house. The beds were comfortable linens fresh and high quality and the kitchen had everything Teri needed to cook up a Texas storm. We were hungry when we arrived and didn't realize the 24-hour HEB grocery was so close so we scooted across the street and met the excellent Javier at El Tacorrido. He and his coworker - we didn't catch her name - fixed us up with tasty Mexican food and Texan hospitality. They stayed open a few minutes later just to serve us their last customers of the day. We had a great night's sleep and awoke the next morning eager to investigate Austin. As we'd decided to pick up a car when leaving we were thrilled with the terrific bus service available 100 feet from Mary's door. We bought $2 all-day ride passes an excellent value and spent our time in Austin checking out the Capitol the Blanton Museum the O. Henry House the funky shops and booteries on South Congress Whole Foods' flagship store the quirky G'raj Mahal (delicious Indian food) and the Austin City Limits Theater to see the Gipsy Kings. On our last morning in Austin Teri and I walked downtown in less than an hour to the Hertz location on E. 10th and were very happy to meet Tim who fixed us up with a nice rental car at a great rate. The people we met during our time in Austin were friendly and helpful to a person no matter how casual our encounter. Austin is a wonderful town full of interesting welcoming folks such as Mary our Airbnb hostess. Mary was quick and clear in all our communication and renting her place got our vacation off on the right foot. I can't say enough good things. Thanks very much Mary! We look forward to staying with you again some time.

522136,4310308,4/27/2013,Irene,Downtown Oasis was a lovely little spot for us.  It was a bit away from the heart of downtown meaning my husband took a $7 cab to his meetings at a hotel downtown.  But as a result it was very quiet and private.  The neighborhood was nice and I walked to downtown on a casual stroll.  The apartment was very clean and well equipped. Alexis left us a welcome message as well as little treats in the fridge and on the kitchen counter. Also provided is a wonderful binder of things to do in the area along with copies of maps we were free to take with us.  Though we never actually met Alexis she was easy to reach via text messaging. The apartment sleeps two comfortably. A fold down futon in the living area sleeps two more but maybe children would be better than a second couple as there would be little privacy.

Lisa provided us with a recommendations and orientation list of restaurants attractions grocery stores etc to help us get familiar with the area. Her tips were wonderful all though I don't think you can visit a bad restaurant in Austin :)

We had a one year old with us so safety was a concern and Lisa did her best to accomodate by reaching out to ask if she should do any special preparation to make it safer.

She also volunteered a monitor and a printer which came in handy since I was working remotely from the apartment during our stay.

During our month there we fell in love with Austin and became spoiled by how close the apartment was to the attractions of the city. We visited many different coffee shops Zilker and McKinney Falls State Park biked along the pathways and much more.

But in the end it is all worth the wait and experience.  This house was a great place to be based while  in Austin as you are not far from the downtown action but  you get the small town neighborhood vibe staying here. We were able to rest well in between taking in all the town had to offer as well as a music fest held outside of town.  We were always happy to come back to the house for rest.

The neighborhood itself has a lot to offer so you don't have to venture to far to get your bar coffee or food services. But if you want the city isn't far at all. Having a car rental was great and really inexpensive...

The owners of the property were really great. They made sure we had everything we needed and more. I was in contact with them the whole time we were there and overall had a great experience.

Their house is located just east of the centre - it takes only a few minutes walk westwards to reach the Texas State Capitol and the centre itself.
My room was large enough and cool to relax in - it's a quiet area too so I had no disturbances at all.

522136,4444965,5/6/2013,Alexis,"We could not have been happier with our stay at the Downtown Oasis! We were in town for a few days for a friend's wedding and by the end of the trip all of our other friends were jealous of our convenient spacious and super clean accommodations. The location of the apartment is nice- it's on a quiet street but it's an easy walk to 6th Street during the day or a super short cab ride if you are coming back at night. It's also very close to the UT campus. 

The host Alexis was so professional! She was helpful friendly responsive and as available as we needed her to be. She was up front with the check in and check out process and was wiling to be flexible. She also went above and beyond by being sure to recommend fun local stuff to check out in the area. She was all you could hope for in an Airbnb host. 

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I want to note that we looked at a few different places on Airbnb for our trip to Austin. Though were tempted by some of the places that were slightly cheaper I am so happy that we went with Downtown Oasis. It was worth every cent and then some.

907229,4464471,5/6/2013,Daniel,"In brief: my experience lodging with Jennifer is just what I expect from the Airbnb community: prompt hospitable pristine accommodations. Her response time is punctual and an immaculate bedroom with private en suite bathroom is just the beginning.

From the moment I contacted Jennifer to the end of my stay the experience left nothing to be desired. I felt at home in the room with fresh linens and decor that clearly demonstrates Jennifer's attention to detail — note the beautifully crafted river rock shower floor.

My decision to stay with Jennifer had a lot to do with her extended family. For animal lovers her home will quickly become your destination. I enjoyed cradling Cordelia (hen) sharing my lap with Princess Buttercup (Nigerian dwarf goat) and playing with Peter Porker (mini piggy).

Jennifer and Tris are exceptional hosts; they struck a balance between inviting me along with them while being mindful of my schedule. A quick jaunt around town and brunch with Peter Porker and Princess Buttercup in tow made for an especially wonderful day.

I'll consider Jennifer my go-to host for Austin. However in truth her success and popularity as a host will keep her calendar full and availability limited. Thank you Jennifer and Tris for being wonderful hosts and sharing your eclectic extended family with me. Also thanks for breakfast tacos they were amazing Tris. :)",Lavishly appointed master bed/bath,4858779,Jennifer

The place is located within walking distance of just about everything you need - from great restaurants to the crazy bars on 6th east.  There is a great wine store just up the street - funky food trailers all around public transit at the door if you need it.

But Coleman is very accommodating and the house and the guests are really nice and cool.  I also like that there is so much greenery land and even chickens!

The bedroom is well represented by the picture the bed very comfortable and the bathroom small but well done.  Great shower!  However the accommodations were still a disappointment for one really big reason.  The smell in their house is close to unbearable.  It's painful to be so blunt but I think necessary.  When you walk in you are in a big open space.  It should be a living room but it not used for that.  But what greets you is the pungent smell of animal urine.  They were open about having a small pig and a dog.  But there are more animals than than (including an adorable mini goat) that live IN the house.  And it smells like it.  The bedroom's smell is much less strong but definitely there.  I couldn't sleep because my nose was burning from the ammonia smell.

Very secluded even though the highway is so close. You pull into a private residential street and then pull into their even more private tree-lined driveway. Very nice peaceful stay. If you need to keep in touch with the hosts their house is just further down the driveway. On site hiking paths was awesome. Probably would've braved going down the trails more had I had better shoes. The whole property in general looks like an artistic public garden a hidden jewel. We ended up bringing our car which makes it easier to travel around and get things that we needed. 

Amenities:
Modern decor cute breakfast nook fruits pastry snacks water bottles coffee/creamer cups/plates/bowls extra blankets books/magazines about Austin plus all the things you would expect from a hotel except better. They even provided things you didn't expect (like a colander!) but it was a pleasant surprise and we made use of these items.

Hosts:
Did not have the pleasure of meeting Melissa but Bill told us that she's in charge of the inside of the loft which is magnificent. Bill was available for us to answer our questions during our stay and even provided us with toothpaste which we forgot to pack. Bill will spend time with you to give you tips on what to do in Austin. Also pointed out that if we chose to keep to ourselves more he was fine with that too.. but we thoroughly enjoyed hanging out with him and the animals.

Overall the stay was wonderful and my boyfriend and I definitely would like to come again. You'll feel enchanted when you first pull up to the loft. The amenities are great and you're provided with up to date guides on attractions in Austin. WIFI was nice so we can watch Netflix on our laptop. You're basically paying for a very comfortable stay and their property/trails makes you feel like you're walking through Austin's public gardens.

He was extremely responsive leading up to our stay and called us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. I did not meet Ryan but my friend did and she thought he was very professional and attentive.

I had been in Austin for a while and was looking for some relaxation which is exactly what I found.  After going downtown for lunch and spending the day in the Austin sun I couldn't wait to get back to the cottage to chill out where it was airy cool and so comfortable!  Steve was so respectful of my privacy and space.  It was so clean and I loved the style: polished concrete floors beautiful wooden shelving all around the studio (which was great for organizing my belongings that had been stuffed in a suitcase for far loo long) and the huge rustic door that separates the bath from the rest of the cottage.  There are large windows all around and I could control my privacy by pulling the shades when I wanted.  The huge metal table in the kitchen was a perfect place for me to work at my computer and to sit and draw.  The small ledge out the back door was a perfect place for me to enjoy my morning coffee: nice and shaded.  Steve was such a great host who left yogurt granola and orange juice for my refreshment so nice!  The photos don't do it justice it is a great place to stay for 1-2 people.

Much closer by within a couple of blocks is the mothership of Whole Foods also an awesome place to eat; an REI next door; and several other places to eat and shop all within walking distance if you're on foot as I was. Also close is access to the running/walking trails that circle Lady Bird/Town Lake. If you're a runner bring your shoes. Cabs are scarce on this side of 6th. You'll need a number handy in your phone if you need to cab. (All the cab companies in Austin tend to get bad reviews in Yelp etc. but I used Austin Cab with no probs and they use Square.)

This is a first floor apartment in a small complex right on 6th street with a coded security gate. It was clean and neat and the cable wireless AC and hot water all worked fine and getting in and out was not problem. There's an equipped kitchen I did not use and a washer/drier. Kristin answered all my questions and communicated well. 6th Street has quite a bit of traffic and as with a city apartment you could sometimes hear traffic noise in the living area but it didn't make its way so much back to the bedroom which is in the back of the unit.

350282,4653707,5/18/2013,Jen,"This little house is great. Exactly as advertised and photographed. Clean. Greg and Mary made it very easy to get in and out — no hassle with the keys. The fridge was better than I expected totally usable for groceries and real cooking. 

I had two frustrations. One the neighbors were quite loud hanging out on their porch until 1am talking about the high drama of their lives playing music. The walls of this house are very thin (like many in east Austin) so I couldn't sleep until the neighbors decided to go inside. I don't know if that happens much maybe hardly ever but it was really annoying the night it happened.

Two the internet is really slow. For most people it'd be totally fine. You can use it to check email and send text no problem. I was traveling for work and needed to do heavier-duty serious network use and under 1mb/sec down was painful. I didn't stay in a hotel in part because I needed real internet access yet the connection at this house (at least in May 2013) was much too slow to get work done fluidly. This could easily be fixed by an upgrade to the plan (super-fast speeds are available from their provider) so maybe they'll upgrade and it'll be faster in the future.

Otherwise I highly recommend the place. It's great to stay in a real neighborhood and see how Austinites live. While I didn't use the bikes having them provided is very cool. I rented a Zipcar and had no trouble parking right in front. Greg told me about car2go which sounded even better — rent a car for just the time you drive it leave it parked in front of their house and someone else will take it away.",1 Bedroom House Close to Downtown!,1709384,Greg And Mary

The loft is located in downtown Austin near the infamous 6th Street. It is also a five to ten minute taxi (or 20 minute walk) to some of Austin's other trendy and hip neighborhoods such as East 6th Rainey Street South Congress.. great areas to shop catch live music eat and people watch!

I looked at places all over the world and ultimately decided on Julia's place. It's small comfortable and clean a perfect getaway for me and my pooch. I loved the 'hood the neighbors were quiet and Julia was just the best. Responsive cool understanding and professional. 

Other bonuses: This apartment is truly livable. Basics like shampoo and body wash were plentiful the kitchen had tons of appliances that I got great use out of and the TV is basically brand new. The OnDemand movie selection was dope. 

The only con which was the slightly slow internet immediately turned pro when I texted Julia and let her know it wasn't working well. She had the modem restarted within twenty minutes. You can't do better than that.

The house was perfect! Full of comfortable furniture to relax in at the end of a long hot day shopping. With many beautiful objects d'art to admire - our hosts really did share a true slice of their lives with us. What a great way to get to know Austin! Kevin very kindly showed us some of the best undiscovered shopping spots and we all scored some wonderful pre-loved clothing treasures that will become icons of our Austin visit more so than our cowboy boots!

Her home sleeps plenty & we were all very comfortable. Her 2nd story balcony is a great place to enjoy a nice meal and good company and her kitchen has all the bells and whistles for the chefs at heart out there !

Christy was very helpful in advance as we planned our trip and genuinely welcoming when we checked in and out.

We felt like we were in an upscale elegant boutique. The bathroom was furnished with plush towels and luxurious spa items for our stay better than any hotel amenities I have ever used. The kitchen was stocked with ice water bottles treats and red bull for our use. The bedrooms are gorgeous as well and both beds were spacious and extremely comfortable. It is nice that there are two floors with a bedroom on each floor so you can have separate spaces for your companions. The location and neighborhood in Austin is perfect and a cab ride to down town only costs around 11 dollars. Terrance and his roommate were very friendly and accommodated all my requests (which were a lot!) they even recommended some places to visit during our stay.

We fell in love with Sara & Jay from Portland! We loved their asethetic and they lived in a similar neighborhood with a similar lifestyle as we do here in our neighborhood in Portland so we felt completely at HOME! Sara was amazing! She was so keenly aware of making sure that that spacious backyard and patio in front of the Spartanette was so peaceful secluded and it felt like it was just us! However our only regret on our trip was not to have been able to spend more time with them! They gave us amazing recommendations! When we met Austinites they were so impressed with where we were staying when we showed them pictures! Austinites were even writing down her info to book stays there! The Spartanette was spacious and felt roomy yet cozy! The bed was SO amazing! The  sheets felt like hotel quality! TONS of storage space so your floor space is free! The bathroom was FAR more spacious than it looks! The shower was amazing! Great pressure! And my 6'4"" husband never had an issue with height inside the Spartanette ever! Sara had freshly ground coffee waiting in our kitchen area with honey & sugar beer in the fridge and cream for coffee! Don't worry about the rooster I barely noticed him awaking the day...and their dogs are so sweet and don't really have a lot of personal contact with people...they keep to themselves so if you're nervous of dogs don't be of these two brothers!!

892618,4704514,5/21/2013,Nanci,"Georgia's house was perfect for my recent graduation trip to Austin. She made the stay easy comfortable and stress-free. She was such a gracious host and we found all the thoughtful things that others have listed when we arrived (hangover kit plenty of linens and towels shampoo toothbrushes etc). She even started us off with some groceries when we arrived! Although she didn't have to she stopped by half way through our trip and left toilet paper on our doorstep (so nice!). Georgia was so pleasant to talk to and was excellent about communicating with me before arriving and during my stay but gave us complete privacy while we were there. She supplied 4 house keys during our stay which made it easy for our group to come and go as we needed.

The house itself was very comfortable. The three bedrooms each have their own unique feel and it's easy to see how much careful attention has been given to each room. The master bedroom is attached to a 3/4 bathroom and the other full bathroom is in the hallway. The couches in the living room and the doors to that room really do easily make that room a fourth bedroom. The kitchen has all the appliances you would need for cooking if that's your thing. She has cable and wifi and the A/C worked great (a must in Austin especially if you're visiting during the summer). She also had a washer dryer detergent and dryer sheets which is awesome because no one likes to travel home with a bunch of dirty clothes. The backyard is very spacious and she has comfortable outdoor furniture. There's also a very sweet kitten that hangs out around the house (but doesn't go inside)...I'm not going to lie if I didn't already own so many pets I probably would have adopted it.

The location is excellent. It's located in Southeast Austin so it's a $12 cab ride from downtown and easily accessible from 35 or 71. Because I had friends and family flying in for my graduation I was at the airport 11 times in 7 days (no kidding) and I was able to get there in 5-10 minutes. If it hadn't been so close I would have probably been miserable sitting in so much traffic. 

All in all I HIGHLY recommend Georgia's house. The house the location and the host were all wonderful. Although I didn't get in early enough to need it Georgia was flexible about the check-in time. When we checked out I did ask if we could check out a little later than planned and she was very sweet about it (which was very much appreciated). I honestly cannot say enough about my experience at Georgia's place. I definitely will be staying there again during future trips to Austin and you should too!

The place is ideal for checking out what real Austin has to offer; it was very convenient to walk to the cool neighborhood bars of East Downtown and if you wanted to see more of the typical 6th street nightlife just walk a few more minutes and you're there.

For checking out the university and some of the other areas like South Congress and North Austin you'll probably want to have a bike. However being a New Yorker walking around was no problem for me.

I was there for a week on business and this place offered ideal quiet space comfort and location. It's close enough to all the action of South Congress but not too close. If you're renting a car the guest house is ideal. The home is nestled behind the main house has its own little path lined with wildflowers separated from the rest of the property. It is beautifully put together the bathroom/shower/etc is clearly brand new and I loved the soap... (it's about the little things after all :-) Esteban and Maria were wonderful hosts...flexible and present... but offering lots of privacy. I arrived late and was able to let myself in without any problem. There was plenty of room to feel at home for a long stay. THANK YOU lovely people for opening up you space. I wish I could clone the property and transport it to my next AIRBNB destination. I will definitely stay with you (if the place isn't booked up) during my next visit to wonderful Austin!

We had a relatively large group of seven guys and the apartment actually accommodated us pretty well. Each of the beds in the bedrooms were very comfortable and the pull out couch in the living room is no joke (think memory foam rather than uncomfortable bar in the back...)! The house was very clean and well maintained.

LOCATION: 
Super safe neighborhood. Less than a minute walk to a market and a bus stop that takes you into downtown in less than 5 minutes. A few-minute walk to a bunch of cool boutiques food trucks restaurants and bars. My girlfriend and I found it fairly easy (despite the heat) to get around by foot or by mixture of bus and foot. Neighborhoods/areas we had no problem getting to by foot: Barton Springs Rainey Street downtown UT and East Austin (the east 6th area). 

HOSTS: 
Wonderful friendly and accommodating people. Able to answer any questions we had.

Within a gated complex. Has a pool a few steps away. Quiet. Well air-conditioned. Spacious bedroom. Clean bathroom. Clean place overall. Washer and dryer seemingly new condition.

The guest house is in a great location as it is close to shopping grocery stores and multiple bus lines within walking distance.  The guest house is located close to the University of Texas and is only a 5 or 10 minute bus ride to downtown the Capital South Congress and Zilker Park.  The house is just the right size for two people on vacation and is well furnished and nicely decorated.  Overall the house is great I would stay here again.  That being said there was a down side; the kitchen isn't well stocked if you're planning on doing any cooking during your stay.  A spatula and knife were the only cooking utensils and though there are some mixing bowls and sauce pans for the stove it lacked pans and bake-ware for the oven.  But since Austin is a Foody town loaded with restaurants finding a place to eat out isn't a problem. I would recommend the Wild Wood Bakehouse for those who are gluten free.  I give the guest house 4 out of 5 stars. ,Maiden Lane Guesthouse ,475506,Dan

I did call a cab one day it was there in ten minutes.  Steve himself a very nice guy he left a paper with a list of recommended stores and restaurants.  I checked out El Chile and Thunderbird Coffee both were great!  One day it rained heavily and Steve brought me an umbrella which was really a lifesaver. If you're headed to Austin you should stay at Steve's if you are not headed to Austin you should really think about it amazing food cheap drinks really friendly people.

5769,4794470,5/26/2013,Chris,I'm forever thankful to Elizabeth and David for letting me stay in their home. I relocated to Austin from Alabama and stayed here for 1 1/2 months during my transition period. I didn't know anyone in Austin but Eliz. & David made sure to keep me involved with their fun activities. From moment one I felt like I had a two good friends. I ran into many tough obstacles getting on my feet in Austin and they were there to lift me up every time I fell. The house is nestled into a really nice area. It's quite convenient and relaxing. Although the house is great the best asset to this place is Elizabeth and David. They are two of the kindest helpful and warm-hearted people you will ever meet. That said they are COOL and ALWAYS on a new adventure. If you're hesitating about renting this place just do it. You won't regret it.

We had decided to go to Austin last minute and request the guest house less than 24 hours prior to leaving for Austin. Luckily it was available and Jaime was very prompt in her reply and communication with me. We had a rough drive down from Dallas due to weather and didn’t arrive until late the first night. Jaime had 2 cold beers waiting for us in the fridge when we finally arrived and told us we could stay as late as we needed on Sunday because of our late arrival Friday night.

The guest house was exactly what the pictures depict very clean and neatly decorated. Everything we needed was right there. A binder on the side table when you walk in tells you everything you need to know about the guest house and things to do in Austin.  Jaime and Mike went above and beyond in recommending things to do both for rain and shine (since the weather as always in TX was unpredictable that weekend). We ended up doing most everything they recommended and had a wonderful time. The location of the guest house is perfect right off of Lamar and close to many bars/ restaurants; also a good bike ride (even shorter drive) to Barton Springs.

321857,4829576,5/28/2013,Elizabeth,"Generally speaking the apartment was a convenient place to crash for a fun girl’s weekend in Austin. The apartment was a decent size for a two bedroom (though not big enough for a group of 7) and Christian was very responsive during the booking process and only a text message away if needed.  We could see certain personalities enjoying this apartment but this was not what we were hoping for. We had the impression the apartment was a vacation rental but the apartment was actually Christian’s primary residence (maybe our fault for not clarifying) in a huge residential complex. The bedrooms were extremely cluttered with boxes and duffle bags; closets were full of boxes books and an extra mattress; other personal items cluttered up the living room and there was leftover food in the fridge. While the apartment appeared to have clean sheets and a plethora of clean towels the apartment was not nearly as clean as a hotel would be.  There was a layer of dust on most of the furniture.  The worst offense though was that the showers were not cleaned and he left considerable amounts of bath products in them such as loofahs and a squeegee. All of this could be fixed by a good scrub from professional cleaners. 
While east Austin was definitely walkable from the apartment it was farther than we had expected based on the write up (and not something you'd want to do in heels!). The write up of the apartment was misleading in other ways.  The write up proclaims that there is a fully stocked beer fridge but fails to mention it is not for visitor use.  Also Christian boasts that he leaves breakfast for his tenants; in reality this included a half empty carton of orange juice and a couple of eggs.  This is not breakfast.

The bedrooms have beds large enough for two.  The living and dining room areas are well appointed and comfortable for hanging out.  

The neighborhood seems to be getting nicer but a short walk(10-15 min) has you in the bars restaurants and shops on E Sixth St and about 30 min walk to downtown.  We rented a car which was necessary to get to some of the areas we wanted to go further south and west than downtown which we had no trouble parking in the driveway but street parking seemed fine too.

I didn't meet Justin&Becca in person and only spoke briefly with Justin on the phone but I feel like I know them. The love and creativity they have poured into this house is contagious and it is magical. We descended upon Austin to let the good times roll at a nearby venue where skee-ball circus and festival carried on for three perfect days. While we did not spend much time at the house during the days – the mornings and the nights were magnificent. 

Making your way down the wide hallway feels like walking inside a giant hollow oak tree. The bedrooms are perky they should be on the cover of Pattern Magazine if that exists. Sleeping in the loft is like sleeping on a bed of cotton candy that is floating in the air. The kitchen you had me at breakfast nook delightful. And lastly I hereby declare from this day forward the backyard will be called Extra Positive Land. There are hula hoops and a happy hut. There is an endless table with light bulbs above it that hang like stars. This backyard is friendship inside of a fence. 

We came to Austin knowing we were going to have the best time of all times. We did not know that we would stay at the best home of all homes casa of all casas pad of all pads. You can say it worked out!

It was just perfect for us. It was clean comfortable and quiet we especially enjoyed the enclosed porch/sunroom off of the dinning room a great place to lounge snack and chat. The pool was great with a very nice deck and chairs for sitting around. Morning and evening swims were very popular and easy. We only saw Virginia when we first arrived and when we asked for something perfect. She was very welcoming and gracious and her description of the place is right on. 
Make no mistake it is not a modern house but it has most modern amenities and many unique features and accouterments.  Virginia will point them out with their stories if you are interested.   Thanks again Virginia. We had a great time!   ",RARE SECLUDED 1940s ESTATE-CENTRAL,1698318,Virginia

It was ideal too because I had my dog with me and after his morning walks he hung out in a swanky little house all day happy as a clam- it's hard traveling with pets so I always appreciate places that are truly pet friendly.  Trudy was great very welcoming and gave suggestions for food locally.  The location is pretty central to Austin for those that may want to split time between downtown Arboretum and the Round Rock area.

I was visiting for a Food Conference at the Hilton (which was the same price as their apartment!) and the location couldn't have been better. Right along the bus line and a $5 pedi cab ride from downtown bars and restaurants...this was a great find! 

Jacob was very prompt answering me after I arrived a little early and he gave me the code to get in the door (which was so easy to have instead of a key) the door was a little hard to get used to but after I few tries I got the hang of it. I met Raquel who popped in to change the laundry and she couldn't have been nicer! She gave me some recommendations and we spoke for a little bit of time before I headed out. 

The surround sound music was awesome the bed was SUPER comfortable and all in all I'm really glad I went with airbnb over a hotel. The only thing I wish this apartment had (after traveling with a carry on) were a few bottles of soap or shampoo! There is a CVS super close-by but it would be nice to have a few amenities. Maybe even a cheap hairdryer?

Austin kind of has a way of doing that to a girl. Enough about that; Chris’ place was a wonderful place to stay. Important: everything is as promised and detailed on the site. But what you don’t know (until you get there) is how accommodating and friendly and helpful Chris is upon your stay.

At 8 months pregnant and traveling with our big dog it can often be hard to find comfort on the road but we couldn't have felt more at home. The kitchen was one of my favorite parts of the house where I spent time making meals and doing laundry in the stacked washer and dryer. There were only two of us so the house was much bigger than our needs and it would totally be comfortable for a larger group of friends or family. My dog loved the neighborhood where we went for long walks every night and people in the neighborhood are all so friendly. It's a short walk to S.

224956,5134185,6/14/2013,Jennifer,"We stayed in the Hideaway for 3 nights and felt very comfortable.  The location is convenient just a block off of SoCo just south of all the shops and restaurants. Some people said they would walk but we personally drove everywhere because we stayed Monday - Thursday and parking was not a problem downtown.  I'm not sure we would've walked very far in the summer heat anyhow but there are also convenient bus stops on Congress as well.  

As far as the actual room we were very pleased.  It felt like home and besides a few instances with the neighbors (and their dog) in the house next door it was very quiet.  Like others have said the air conditioner in the bedroom was a bit louder than we would've liked which was fine for us if it stayed on or off.  We kept the fan on continuous while we slept (otherwise it woke us up all night).  The bed was comfortable except we were needing an extra pillow or two.  They were the kind of pillows that deflate not long after lying on them so they required a lot of fluffing and repositioning.  Next time we will bring our own.  

The bathroom was very nice and clean.  The towels were velvety soft and pleasant smelling.  The only toiletries provided were toilet paper a bath bar and hand soap so make sure that you come prepared.  

We didn't use anything in the kitchen besides the fridge but it appeared to be stocked with plenty of dishes and utensils for cooking a nice meal.  

To review: We most enjoyed the comfortable feeling of home and the towels they provided.  It is definitely small and cozy so no more than 2 people is right.  The parking was convenient and reliable which is perfect when you're coming and going.  Our only complaints were the pillows and the air conditioner disturbing our sleep.  Otherwise a very pleasant stay.  We highly recommend this room and we will probably explore the other rooms offered by Joe & Bella on this same property next time.  Thank you!

The home smelled great. 
The private bath was like going to a high class spa.  I loved the rock shower and it made my tired feet feel massaged.
Home is eye candy I felt like I was in a museum. I sat in the morning and just admired all the art. Some she did and some were friends pieces.  I even tried on some garb (costumes)/and head pieces that Jennifer made.  I Purchase a beautiful comb.

Most are confined to the aviary. All are outside except Rainbow can come and go.
I have other events coming: Texas Ren Fest Sherwood forest and because I know Jennifer I want to always stay with her.

78974,5185897,6/17/2013,Ruggy,"Dan's place was exactly as advertised: a nice inexpensive spot to crash in one of the more hip areas of town (South Congress). Chances are you'll be discovering the city so the time you spend in the actual unit is likely to be far less than what you'll spend at the cottage itself. That said the space is comfy it has the basic amenities you'd wish for in a hotel setting (towels TV some local beers in the fridge A/C etc...) and it's in a really great location. Score. 

If you're at all squeamish about bugs you may find a few critters lurking on the walls when you get home at night. This is likely much more a product of Austin's muggy summer conditions than Dan's neglect for sure. It wasn't a huge deal but it's something worth sharing.

The place is very spacious and artsy. The bedroom we stayed in was nice and the electricity worked the entire time we were there (almost) with no problems. My only issue was the fact that Coleman leaves the door open all day and night in order to let the breeze in the house because it is solar powered and there are only fans in the house. Because of this there probably lives the entire mosquito population of texas coming in and out of the house. My girlfriend got bit really badly by the mosquitos every night despite the mosquito net that is provided over the bed. So as long as you are not susceptible to mosquitos and other insects that might be lurking around. I would recommend a stay in this interesting home.,Eco nature retreat in community ,681301,Coleman

The house manual is laminated and available at your bedside in case you need bikes or to use the washing machine or whatever. It is so entertaining it is the only set of instructions my sister carla and I have ever read cover to cover.  

I don't know what you know about Austin but during July it is hotter than the sweat patches on Scarlet  Johannason's catsuit. As a result the consistent steady air-conditioning was appreciated. 

The location is tip-top only two blocks from 6th St. (east) which has all of your food beverage and tattoo needs covered. It's a short bike ride to the river which is so rad. Ride bikes in Austin. Just do it. 

The washer and drier work and work well and are entertaining for a cheeky bonus. The washing machine is a monument that stands testament to this house's Macguyvering skills. 

The bed sleeps two people who really don't want to touch each other comfortably just watch your shins on the frame around the outside. 

This house provides ample towels. One face cloth one wash cloth and one big fluffy comfy towel towel. 

The bathroom is supreme and so fresh and so clean clean. The kitchen is decked out however the food in Austin rocks so you maybe won't need that.

635732,5234326,6/19/2013,Evan,"Stayed with Gray and Judith for a week and it was a very good experience overall!

price per night was really reasonable for being so close to the downtown area (if I remember right 10 minutes to Stubbs and 15 to 6th street bars walking and close to CVS before you even cross the highway-- I rented a bike after the first day though kind of more conducive to covering ground in Austin). They had a Keurig machine and a nice outdoors/patio area and awesome dogs -- Grace and George. Big awesome dogs. 

The bed was just above the living room with a curtain for privacy and a fan to keep heat down but as someone else reviewed you do sort of have to change your clothes in the horizontal unless you use the bathroom and if things are going on you can hear them. Luckily once I'm asleep I'm a heavy sleeper and Gray and Judith were really quiet; and Gray wasn't home a large part of the time.

Only downsides I can think of is that I thought it was going to be in an upstairs room not like a bunk but I guess I misinterpreted the pictures more than anything and they have a bike (and offer a U-lock gratis still) BUT the bike is not working so I had to use a rental bike service in town. If I were them I'd just update that in the description. 

Also another plus I never really used it but Gray has electronics galore: Apple TV an Internet radio stereo an iPod touch to control the Philips lights and other gadgets spread throughout. Really made it more cool! 

Ah and to corroborate the internet/wifi is indeed FAST. Which made everything better to boot. And the shower is hot its a standing shower in a bathroom near the kitchen and Gray's room. Very spacious. 

And feel free to ask Gray and Judith for some recommendations on what to do they have maps to help guide your way if you aren't tech inclined or run low on battery often. ", 4 lofty lovers - walk to Downtown!,2369539,Jude

The house has everything you need including drinkware/glassware bowls and jars. The ceiling is high in the house so it gives it a very open feel.  The bed is very comfortable and the futon is comfy too - the option for the 3rd futon/mattress/bed would be a better alternative than the floor but I brought an air mattress just in case and am glad I did. On a hot day walking into the cold house feels great! Overall great place to stay.  I have several friends that live overseas and out of the state and will highly recommend your comfortable abode.

He's a kind thoughtful and gracious host who didn't mind sharing conversations or meals.  Tim makes you feel right at home.   The pictures of his home don't do it justice.  It's so spacious and full of light.  The modern furnishings and original artwork seem like they've jumped from the pages of a magazine.  The bedroom suite has a large walk-in closet to keep your things.  The attached bathroom had plenty of space for two to share the mirror when getting ready.  Fresh towels and a basket of toiletries are ready for those who may have forgotten something.  There is a tv in the bedroom but we didn't use it.  The bedside lamp had a dimmer switch which was a nice touch as I was trying to read while my daughter slept.   Tim provided a map of the area with helpful information.  There are major stores close by; and it's a quick hop on the freeway to get around town.

Our main destination was a concert downtown.  The venue was wonderful but beware of the valet parking.  Our car was nowhere to be found when the concert ended and we were stranded downtown until we called a cab ($20 ride) to take us to Tim's house.  We were unable to retrieve our car until the following evening.  It's a common occurance according to the policeman and taxi driver.  This is absolutely no reflection on our stay with Tim.  Just a bit of advice for those who aren't familiar with the area.  Make sure the valet you choose is associated with the event you are attending.  Ours unfortunaely was for a restaurant at the opposite end of the block which was only open 5-9 p.m.  We told the valet where we were going but he didn't tell us his hours.  Our mistake for assuming.

Their house feels like home as soon as you get there probably due to Andrew and Justin. Their house is in a great location for experiencing the real austin. Walking distance to lots of cool bars and food trucks and to 6th st (if that's your thing). Also in between 3 bus routes so very easy to get to Barton Springs (which is a must) and downtown.

It has quick access to all the life of the city on 6th street and can be a quiet oasis from the outside world when needed. The graffiti in the living room was a nice touch as was the city skyline and sunset providing an inspiring ambiance in the evening. We used the rooftop deck every night - getting a view of the city at night and getting a little fresh air before crashing for the night. The apartment was well appointed with all the tech setup you'd need (Apple TV Cable really strong WiFi etc.).

And we liked how flexible the place was - from handling our small team of 6 to accommodating a party of 25. The place didn't skip a beat!

Next time we're in Austin we're staying here for sure. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to experience all Austin has to offer from the heart of the action!",Swanky Townhome on 6th Street!,814883,Kristen

956781,5417388,6/29/2013,Katrina,"Steve's house is a beautiful piece of art. Loved the modern granite floor downstairs and bamboo floor upstairs the skylight windows that allowed natural light to filter in during the day the cute little yard that I go out to look at greens when I stare too long at the computer catching a view of ecletic houses nearby (turkeys ran around a neighbor's backyard another few had interesting metal gates) other design elements in the house. My group of 5 thoroughly enjoyed our 1-week stay there. 
We found out that this house is even less than 1 year old so it is understandable why a high deposit is required.

There are enough bathrooms -2.5baths - to use for everyone (we loved that) enough space and mattresses to sleep on we bought groceries and used the kitchen to cook breakfasts and meals (of course we washed our own dishes) I personally loved that the trash is divided 3 ways - food scraps normal and recyclables. Everyone loved the sophisticated washer and dryer as well and not to forget there is a cool alarm system in the house that we always use when we leave the house or before we sleep at night. The house is also very centrally located if you have business in downtown Austin.

When we want to do takeout there are several foodtrucks nearby including a nice one across the street (mm...fried chicken bites and plantains..) that made meals easy and cheap. Friends living in the area also took us to Mt Bonnelle to see the wonderful view and sunset and many nice restaurants in the area. We didn't even have to go far to go pub crawling there's a whole bunch of pubs and clubs just on the west side of 35.

The neighborhood is in development so you will find a mix of nice new houses boarded up ones and very old ones. 

Steve and Anne's place is i may say like a magical oasis and we are very happy to have the chance to stay at their house. They have been very good hosts. Steve replied our questions as soon as he could before and throughout our stay he even responded to our call in the wee hours when we tripped the alarm.

We had many laughs discussions work meetings late night talks cocktail sessions at the house. My first impression of life in downtown Austin couldn't have been better. Thanks to Steve and Anne we will be back if we have a chance. :)",Central/East Modern Austin Home,5201334,Steve

This apartment is nicely decorated very clean fast wifi full kitchen with furnishings and had everything one could ask for; so much better than a hotel room! Kristen was kind to leave some bottled water chips and fruit in the kitchen. A very nice touch. I will definitely stay here again should I visit Austin in the future and give it my highest recommendation.

I decided against staying at the host hotel and decided to try out Jason's East Side Cabana. First of all for the cost of the cabana I would have only gotten to stay at the host hotel for about 3 or 4 days. So it was definitely a bargain. 

The cabana was beautiful and comfortable. It looked just like the pictures that are shown on the site. Jason was very accommodating during my visit. Whenever I needed his assistance. He was there to aid me within 2-3 minutes response time. The place was very clean and cozy and in a quiet and safe area. Safety is a definite must when traveling and lodging out of town. The cabana is also 6 minutes away driving time / 15-20 minutes walking regular pace time from downtown Austin.  Very close. The neighborhood also has a lot of treasures like local restaurants and vendors.

668873,5474914,7/1/2013,Theresa,"This place is in a great location. It was just a couple of minutes by car to South Congress where there are lots of places to eat and some ""different"" places to shop...near 6th St. too.  I say different because it wasn't probably the things I would shop for but I guess this is part of what keeps Austin weird!  Lindsay's place is also very clean and comfortable and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone. The beds and linens were great quality and we slept like babies. This is my first time as an Airbnb user so I was very hesitant to use the site at first because we didn't want to stay in someone's everyday house with all of their stuff.  This place is a true ""rental"" which is what we were looking for. I did tons of research and read hundreds of reviews before making a reservation. My hubby and I were pleased and so was the other couple who went with us! There were a few little hiccups in the reservation process at first.  The price that was quoted ($190 per night plus $46 for Airbnb fee with cleaning included) when I entered the dates for the place was not the price that showed up when Lindsay agreed to let us book...her original offer ($524) was $100 more for the weekend. When asked about it she didn't know exactly why the price came up to that so she went in and made a second booking price offer ($448) which was still more than what was listed when viewing her place on the site.  After my third message to her she did get the price to be exactly what we were seeing on the site ($426). I'm still not exactly sure how the original offer wasn't a reflection of the price showing on the site but make sure you check prices when booking just to make sure. We also had to ask for more towels (only 3 were left for 4 people for 2 days). I truly think this was just an honest mistake that probably doesn't happen often at all. When I messaged about it we received a call very quickly and towels were brought to us the next morning. It also seems as if the last guest or someone switched some of the wires for the TV and cable around because we couldn't get this to work until my husband checked the cables and realized that they were not plugged in correctly...an easy fix but a little frustrating for a few minutes. Even with these minor occurances we were super happy to stay at this place. You can rest assured that you will be comfortable when you decide to stay at Lindsay's rental!! Just FYI...we loved eating at Kerbey Lane's Home Slice Pizza the Hula Hut the Crepe food truck on S. Congress and Gourdough's Donuts.

Terrance answered my inquiry immediately and once I'd booked answered every one of my texts within minutes! He let me stop by a week ahead of time to check out the place and let me check in 2 hours earlier than policy so I could decorate for the bachelorette party we were having...without charge. He voluntarily bought a coffee maker before our arrival after I text him asking if there was one present...also no charge. We ran out of batteries for the air mattress pump we had brought and casually text him to ask if he had any stashed in the apartment that we could steal...he replied immediately and didn't have any spares in the condo but (voluntarily) had them on the doorstep the next morning. Also no charge. Last but not least Terrance stuck to the flat rate he advertised regardless of the number of occupants (we brought our own extra air mattresses)!  This saved us easily $600+ as 95% of Austin hotels charge at least $35/night for any occupant over TWO.

The condo itself was beautiful (high ceilings huge sitting area and VERY clean); great location (literally 3 minute cab ride to downtown Rainey area SoCo Zilker Park and the culinary MECCA that is South 1st); pool was lovely (although seating is lacking for more than about 10 people and only about two ""layout"" chairs; didn't bother us in the least but an FYI); the bathrooms were very clean and there were a ton of fresh towels left for us. **Also (the REAL steal in my opinion)...ample *free* street parking directly in front of the condo!!!! Take it from a local Austinite - this is HUGE. 95% of the hotels within 10 miles of downtown charge $22-$35 PER car PER night for SELF parking...and the only alternative option- metered parking around town- charge all day $1/hour with a 3-hour max...meaning you get to stop by the meters every 3 hours to feed them. Cabs are in surplus here so to not have to deal with the nightmare that is downtown Austin parking and the potential hundreds of dollars more was wonderful. 

I rely heavily on user reviews for just about everything and find them IMMENSELY helpful when they're honest so if I had a single bad thing to say about this rental I would include it here without exception...I do not. I'm born and raised here and know the city inside & out...this is EXACTLY what you'd want for an Austin getaway with friends SxSW ACL or football season!

What a great house for entertaining and very comfortable bedrooms for our two night stay during the 4th of July weekend. This house has cold AC and very very clean. It has all the amenities needed to make our stay effortless. There was nothing overlooked by Crystal when she stocked this house for our stay.
I must say Crystal is a smart young lady and communicates well. She helped us with our concerns and even helped us with local things to do such as restaurants bars and things for our two 14 year olds. Surprising too was the fridge stocked with beer and soda for arrival. Never ever see that anywhere.
The location is very close to the highway and our arrival and departures were quick and easy to navigate.

He was very nice and even brought us back some tacos from his late-night taco run - they were delicious. He was never in the way and for the most part felt like had our own house when we were there - although most of the time we were out doing things. The only negative part of our stay is that the back room does not get as good AC as the rest of the house so woke up sweating the first morning - adjusted the thermostat the next night.

908903,5663197,7/10/2013,Dot,"Ok so we were new to Airbnb and a little wary of the entire concept and we were trying to conserve funds. As first-timers we really could not have lucked out any better. You're reading a ton of reviews I'm sure so here's the run down of reasons why you should skip looking around and double down on Jen & Jon.

- HOSTS: Two of the nicest ""normal"" folks you'll meet on Airbnb (even tho it seems like everyone in Austin is nice). They were legit in offering us beers snacks anything to make our stay more comfortable and even invited us out. Which we obliged. They honestly should be working for the city's tourism office given how helpful they are about getting to know the city.

- BED: When they talk about how great the bed is they're right. My boyfriend is 6'4"" and we typically sleep in a king. He now wants to buy a Temperpedic bc of how much he loved their bed. The sheets on on the bed seemed to be brand new and she provided plenty of extra pillows or blankets. Room was clean and stocked with free mags a little bathroom amenity basket and a hairdryer.

- COST/LOCATION: Sure there are sexy lofts and apartments downtown available but not within a price that justified opting out of a hotel. But Jen & Jon have priced this room perfectly. The location is not dead center in all of the action so if you have a car its perfect for getting around the entire city. You have access to their spacious living room and kitchen you don't feel like you are in their private space and sort of feel like you live there (for those of you thinking about moving).

- PARKING: You don't want to look for or pay for parking at 1am after a fun night on S. Congress their neighborhood has plenty of street parking I honestly think they would let you use their driveway.

Their dogs are adorable we miss them! They do a little barking at you when you arrive or leave but it literally lasts 10 seconds tops- we thought it was funny. We had plenty of privacy and didn't feel smothered by hosts that needed to be our best friends.

Happy renting feel free to contact me w any further questions abt this great place and awesome couple.

It's located in a nice residential neighborhood - very quiet and comfortable to come home to but also fairly close to everything else in Austin.  There are some nice restaurants and bars within walking distance from her location and the main attractions in the city are all within a 2 mile radius.

Since my stay came in the middle of the summer it's also worth mentioning that the A/C works great.  There's a temperature gauge you can set and the unit can actually reach that temp even when it's hot outside.  I'm a northerner so this was a pleasant surprise.

All in all I highly recommend the condo - anytime I'm back in Austin this will be the first place I check.  Angele is great to deal with as well - always responsive and friendly.  ",Clarksville Condo - Minutes to DT!,119441,Angele

Her house itself is roomy and clean her dog is an absolute delight and did not make a noise during my whole 3 day stay. As a seasoned host Leslie had a box in my room with a ton of travel essentials ( from shampoo to bug spray to face wash ) which is really thoughtful of her to have put there. Having lived in Austin for well over 10 years she knew all the best spots to go to to drink at  to make friends at and she shared her knowledge freely. Since I am a woman traveling alone she made a ton of time for general small talk and was nice enough to answer my millions of questions ( from general curiosity to ""big"" 21 year old female dramas ).

I couldn't believe how much storage/organizational space we had for toiletries make up accessories clothes etc etc.....(yes I tend to over pack). The added bonus was all the snacks in the fridge beer wine coffee tea water - even topo chico and juices - never had to run to the store for anything. I loved the chickens roaming around and the visits from Bob the cat. The only drawback was that the neighbors across the street decided to have a bass bumping party - which was shut down by mother nature - an awesome lightning and thunderstorm. I was worried the parties were gonna be a nightly occurrence being that it was the beginning of the weekend  - but it it never happened again must have been a special occasion. Anyway this was truly a delightful stay and will def be my go-to for future visits.

934074,6117751,7/30/2013,Tim,What a great place to stay.  Just the right size for a couple or three people to stay as well as to entertain a small group of family or friends in the living room.  Our son and his girlfriend live only several blocks away so the location was perfect them to swing on over.   There's a floor to ceiling glass window that looks out over an attractively landscaped backyard area.  The surrounding leafy neighborhood (Hyde Park) is lovely with a variety of well-kept homes that are pleasing to the eye.  Just three blocks to some cafes eateries and a great grocery story and the 18 to 20 minute walk to the UT campus with all that it offers is very pleasant.  Easily a three-person stay as long as the third person who stays doesn't mind going up the ladder and nestles into the cozy loft area.  The loft is part of and overlooks the bedroom.    We talked to Mark over the phone a couple of times and he responded right away to any questions or requests.  Otherwise Mark and Monica who live in the main house on the same property kept out of the way making it feel like we had the place all to ourselves.

The AC does a reasonable job fighting the summer heat and the deck is a great place to hang out w/friends and a nice glass of wine.

It is close to my favorite places in Austin namely South Congress South 1st Barton Springs and the 2nd street district. 
As other reviewers stated Gretchen is there when you need her and not there when you don't. You feel like it is your place without having to see anyone other than Betty and Repo (the dogs) if that is what you want. I was thrilled with the dogs because I had a dog at home whom I missed and Betty was like a rent-a-dog for me. Repo was a bit aloof and wasn't as affectionate as Betty but cute and non-aggressive non-the-less. Betty had good manners and wouldn't come in the house if not invited. I know I am going on and on about the animals but for me they meant a lot and were the icing on the cake! 
The house is just perfect and very clean and well stocked. We even cooked a lasagna dinner one night. (We bought disposable foil pans for that). My friend stayed the first 4 days with me and then I was alone. I felt completely safe and just loved coming home to ""my place"" after walking the streets of Austin.

There are great restaurants serving local food a quaint market neighborhood park and pool within walking distance.  The grounds were so peaceful that it actually felt like we were staying at a retreat.  My eight year old son really enjoyed playing on the jungle gym while my older daughter and I spent quality time together.  The room was perfect and the outdoor shower was awesome!  Marcus was a fantastic host providing information and ideas on what to do in the local area.  And by the way the coffee was bold flavorful and roasted locally.  We definitely recommend the Cool Hyde Park efficiency apartment (aka The Burrow) to all that visit Austin.  We will be staying there whenever we return to the area!

Alexis was a fantastic host and her Downtown Oasis is a wonderful place to stay while exploring all that Austin has to offer. She was very thoughtful and even left an assortment of snacks and soft drinks for us in the kitchen!

The place was immaculate and tastefully furnished with many Ikea pieces. The linens were clean and soft and the A/C was cold. If you are coming to Austin without a car I highly recommend signing up for a Car2Go carshare account prior to arriving and downloading the Ridescout app. We were visiting from DC (which also has Car2Go) but I've never seen such a dense concentration of Car2Go Smart cars in one place. Bus service throughout the city was pretty good as well and a lot of bus routes run just two short blocks away at 17th and Guadalupe. Downtown is just a short walk away but getting to South or East Austin is a little bit farther so a bus or car comes in handy in those instances.

Our one complaint was a pair of noisy dogs in the unit next door. It seemed to be another vacation rental unit possibly even airbnb due to the lock box on the door handle. The unit sounded like it was empty the first couple of days but on the day before we left someone moved in with a pair of very yappy dogs that barked incessantly. Annoying? Yes. End of the world? No. We were out so much that we didn't have to listen to them that much.

It would have been nice if the building offered recycling. We felt pretty bad about trashing so much recyclable material.

Jennifer was more than accommodating she made sure that when we came into town we would be able to get in the house (we came relatively late and she was out) and had ice water waiting for us in our beautiful room! A nice surprise after a long hot day of travel.  The room and bathroom are gorgeous and unique we felt like royalty.  A perfect compliment to an awesome city!

Her home is in a fairly safe neighborhood about a 2 minute drive right into the city. It is in a gentrified part of the city so I wouldn't recommend walking at night if you are a single woman traveler but if definitely safe if you want to take a bike ride to town. There is a great cafe called Cenote just a short walk away that has really great breakfast/brunch burritos and wifi. South Congress is just short distance drive with really great restaurants and shops. I rented a car which I would recommend if you really want to see the city. 

It was nice to have my own separate entrance so that I could come and go as I please without disturbing anyone. The room is spacious and nicely equipped with a desk dresser and a wardrobe bar to hang your clothing on. She supplies you with bathroom towels to shower and even a beach towel if you're going for a swim... All around a great place. I would definitely stay there again while in Austin.

There is no place like this one and if you're staying in Austin you should do yourself a favor stop looking and stay at Joey and Stephanie's. We've stayed at dozens of airbnbs hotels and motels during our summer road trip and this Austin find was by far the best one yet. It's close enough to all the Austin weirdness but far enough away to go back to their place and chill out for the night.

The only downfall would have to be that it was hard to leave the great home-brewed coffee the cozy breakfast bench complete with delectable morning goodies (like strawberries and English muffins which Stephanie so kindly provided for us) the ridiculously comfy couch and satellite TV the uber plush bed and pillows and all-in-all the awesomely decorated and perfectly air conditioned private guesthouse.

50310,6665889,8/20/2013,Julian,There's not much Sevylla doesn't know about Austin or the music scene here - she really is the best intro you could have to the city particularly if you're a musician.  I stayed here for a week and for once couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  I don't drive so had to rely on the buses - not a problem here as they pick up and drop off within a few doors of the studio.  I was in town or back home within a half hour and the 24hr $2 fare was cheap enough to do a few cross-town routes in-between.  The neighborhood was friendly and the store close enough to stock up on beer wine and whatever I needed before heading out into town (generally beer and wine so I was good).  The room was everything you see here - clean private quiet and cool enough to deal with the Texas heat.  You can come and go as you please and Sevylla is only a text away from any advice you might need for whatever you want to get out of your stay in Austin.  I'll certainly be staying here again in future and advise that you book it post-haste if you see a gap in the calendar - I promise you'll not regret it.  A word has to be said about Sevylla herself who was such a warm generous and fun person to meet - a true ambassador for both Austin and Airbnb. If every Airbnb host was of this calibre we'd all be putting hotels out of business.  This is where travel gets way more interesting - meeting local folk who love their town and want to show you the best of it.

We absolutely loved it! Loved the retro style the peacefulness and the location.  The space was immaculate and well appointed. 
We had rented a car at the airport but found that we didn't need to use it on the days spent exploring the city of Austin.
Our favorite part of the city was that which was right on our doorstep and/or a short walk away along the S. Congress corridor. Sort of a Bohemian/Hip feel...  
Lots of interesting choices for dining at all price points interesting shops and met some interesting people in this neighborhood.
I highly recommend Gretchen's Funky Guest House and would not hesitate to stay here again should my future travels include a journey to Austin.

1133017,6732717,8/23/2013,Nicole,"The Gypsy Caravan was an absolute dream and perfect vacation escape. It's located in Mickie's backyard and is a lot more private than I was anticipating. The windows to her house are closed off so you essentially have this huge well-landscaped outdoor space to yourself. You also have your own private entrance so you won't need to worry about disturbing anyone living in the house.

The decor was jaw dropping and I loved the outdoor seating area. The bathroom would get pretty hot since it wasn't near the AC so I always opted for the very private outdoor shower (my favorite part). Getting clean while working on your tan at the same time -- it doesn't really get much better than that.

Many hours were spent listening to the vintage record player while relaxing on the deck with some Shiner Bock. I never saw Mickie during my trip and the privacy is exactly what I needed (I'm sure she's a lovely lady though!). She really thought of everything -- dishes towels toiletries cleaning supplies etc. was all there so you didn't have to worry about having to go to the store and purchase anything.

Jamie's loft is perfect. Perfect location on East 4th Street with easy access to anything I needed - Wanderlust Yoga Gold's gym Rainey Street spectacular food kick-ass bars smoothie bars the Alamo Drafthouse Ritz cinema and the river were all within stone-throwing distance.

The loft looked amazing inside. Anybody who saw it commented on it. The air-con was a sub-arctic temperature. I can't comment on the TV because Austin is way too interesting to stay inside. Jamie had condiments spare if you maybe forgot something shopping. Ditto with some toiletries. She also left some great advice on bars and restaurants.

Halfway through my time there Jamie organised her friend to clean the loft. Her friend cleaned it so well that I was scared to even leave any mess after that. It looked immaculate. She ever did all my clothes and folded them which was unexpected but extremely generous.

My only wish for this place is that I could have extended haha. I think the local law makes you tap out after three weeks.

We didn't do any cooking (because of all the amazing restaurants within walking distance) but the kitchen was certainly well-equipped if we had wanted to cook.  2 bedroom 2 bath but also has a queen futon in a room off of the kitchen.  We were 4 gals and one guy (the guy slept on the futon).  Worked great the only downside was that you must enter the bedrooms to use the bathrooms so he had to wait until we were up before he could go!  Not a big deal just something to consider.  There were plenty of linens and the home is very clean.  

The owners have put together a great little Austin guide with restaurant recommendations.  Some of our favorites: South Congress Cafe (went there twice) and of course Jo's coffee.  The ice cream shop Amy's was a nice treat (especially when you have triple-digit temps). We also enjoyed Parkside on 6th Street.  It was really too hot to avail ourselves of all the great food trucks.  Do not miss the flagship Whole Foods!  And Uncommon Objects on S. Congress is wonderful we could have spent hours there.  We were there for BatFest though we only took in the bat exodus not much of the music.

Kitchen was very good with good cooking equipment to make small or big meals. Dryer and washing machine work and Tyler keeps his room pretty clean. Queen size bed is comfortable.

The only thing that could have been better was the airco in the room. The airco makes some noise so I turned it down while sleeping. It wasn't that much of a problem because the room stays cold long enough for me to fall asleep  but worth mentioning.

All in all a very good experience and would recommend!",1 mile from city center/6th st.  ,2267797,Tyler

We immediately let Kat know and within an hour she had responded and let us know the cleaner would be there shortly. It turned out her cleaner wasn't able to service the apt for another few hours due to heavy traffic so Kat comped us the first night PLUS the cleaning deposit. This was class A customer service.

It's clean very spacious and the location is superb:  I came visiting from NYC and felt right at home with a Homeslice Pizza less than a quarter-mile away and a 24-hour Magnolia Cafe nearby.

The last thing I wanted to worry about was having access to things I needed.  The house is two blocks away from South Congress Avenue which means access to cafes restaurants bus transportation bars barber shops grocery stores etc ...  It's close enough to many conveniences and just far enough to have a quiet good nights rest.  Throughout my stay I really felt like I had control over my schedule as all of these amenities were very close by.

The house had great options to relax and talk inside and outside on the porch when the weather got a little cooler. Bedrooms were comfortable (each one had a ceiling fan) and all located downstairs so we could go upstairs for coffee and not disturb others. We also enjoyed looking through his book collection--some great picks on design.

The location is walking distance to some cool bars on 6th street. The neighborhood is in a state of gentrification so it's not the best walk for sightseeing.

We had a great time at Rachel's guest house. It was a very nice space -- so much nicer than any hotel we could have stayed at for the same price and it really was perfect for a family with young kids. The sofa pulled out into a bed just the right size and height for our almost 3 year old twins to sleep on and there were so many toys for them to play with! They were especially taken with the ride in car and gas pump. They spent hours riding back and forth and ""refiling"" the gas tank! It was a surprisingly large space and well laid out so the kids had plenty of space to play and burn some energy. There was also a play area outside which they used briefly but it was really too hot to do much outside. The kitchen was just the right size to fix breakfast and we could easily have made a simple lunch or dinner too if we'd been there longer. There were plastic plates cups and utensils for the kids (and normal dishware for the adults) so I didn't have to worry about them accidentally breaking anything. There was even a small table and chairs so they had a comfortable place to sit and eat. Like I said a perfect place for anyone traveling with young kids! The only complaint I had was the queen size bed in the bedroom was very firm... but I didn't notice that complaint in any of the other reviews I read so maybe it's just me. I do tend to prefer a soft mattress. Other than the bed we were so impressed with the studio we definitely plan on staying at Rachel's again next time we're Austin!

The location is so close to South Congress yet it is in a very quiet neighborhood. Right around the corner is a convenient HEB grocery store. When we got there Tony was very welcoming and made sure to show us all the features of the Little Monstrosity. I really liked the lofted bed and the added touch of a climbing a ladder to the private bed was really cool. Tony even provided some speakers for us so that we could play music in the house. The place is clean and private with plenty of room to store your bags and hang your clothing. Parking was always available at all times of the day either on the street or in the driveway. If you don't have a car or just plan on walking or biking everywhere it is very easy to get to the restaurants and bars on 1st street and South Congress from the house. There is even a small and private enclosed courtyard with a table and chairs. For those hot and sunny Texas days there is a very convenient sunshade above the table and chairs to keep you comfortable. If you stay here make sure to get yourself some Gourdough's Donuts or stop by Elizabeth's for an excellent bowl of pho. I would stay here again and again.

The one lost star is only due to it being a little out of the way for our taste (we got tired of taking cabs everywhere) but as soon as we rented a car the location became a non-issue and had an amazing time. We never actually met Sovay but someone from the salon out front answered when we called to inquire about a parking permit for their lot and met us within 5 minutes to hand it over to us.

We met both her gorgeous black kittens and puppy Dimitry. What a beautiful clean home! Large fully equipped kitchen powerful shower wall mounted TVs in almost every room and a large garden.
The house is about 10 minutes out of town but we used public transport on most days. We went to Stubb's on the first evening to listen to Ed Sharpe and it was a great start to a fantastic city. Barton Springs was a little further away but we drove there on our last evening in Austin and it was such a refreshing relief from the humidity of the sun. We would definitely advise a visit to South Congress in particular to Gemma's Jamaican Food Truck and the vintage shops. Really great coffee and bars in that area too.

On the whole it is a pleasant place and surprisingly hospitable; Alexis provides a clean roll of hand-towel for use washing liquid a fridge filled with a few boxes of juices and some snacks etc and tea bags & coffee at the kitchen table.
There is also a clean whistling kettle and sufficient utensils.
The oven is in a tip-top working condition that heats up in no time.  Washing machine area is so nearby and accessible (just next to our apartment).  The entire apartment is covered by very good condition mosquito netting that keeps the insects away; we were not bitten by any mosquitoes.  It has a spacious living room and a large and nice dressing table just outside the bath room.  Alexis even provides good quality bath soup (Dove).
 
The living room has a beautiful ceiling fan that makes the environment feels very homely.

69352,7270316,9/13/2013,Lauren,When we arrived at the Zilker cottage it was even more enchanting than in the photos. The front porch is wreathed in climbing vines and looks oh so welcoming. I wish the interior lived up the exterior charm a little more--it was a fine place made all the better by Sovay's very savvy Austin recommendations and guide she left for us (we felt like we had the inside scoop!) but it was a little dark for our tastes. We tend to like things kind of bright though so if you are okay with a cozier atmosphere this the place for you. Lighting aside the kitchen bedroom and bath had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the shower was good too. There are some great touches--the kitchen has filtered water there are lots of interesting books on the shelf there is a basket of bath goodies for you the aforementioned guides to Austin. Sovay wasn't there but her father was and he was a great host--left us to our own devices unless we needed anything which is perfect in our book. Sovay's recommendations were fantastic--again made us feel like we had the inside track. Don't miss out on Elizabeth St. Cafe--we loved it so much we at there twice in two days!

Marcella and her family were generous with confections but also respected my privacy.  Positioned in a lovely back garden the trailer is a very pleasant place to spend your time in Austin.

Our group never felt anywhere near cramped (each able to sleep on there own bed or air mattress) and the 3 separate houses arrangement allows for those that want a little more peace and quiet to isolate themselves. Also the main house is big enough to fit 10+ people for an indoor gathering if you need (useful for breakfast for our group) though the outdoor pool/yard space was certainly our favorite attraction.  We never had any problems getting to/from downtown or finding food and David was quick to respond via both airbnb and email when that became necessary.

1.  Luckily none of us were allergic to cats because I had no idea til I showed up and she walked out.  Was checked as an ""amenity"".
2.  The chickens in the coop might wake you up.  I should have thought about that more...

We live in NYC so we walked everywhere in Austin BUT we did rent bikes one day from Austin Bike Tours & Rentals and they delivered and picked up from her place. (There are 2-street bike racks in front of her building). Alexis' place sits right on a main bike thoroughfare that brings you to the start of one of the many bike paths in Austin. Alexis also had information about restaurants and sight seeing. Cable TV and WiFi access. I highly recommend staying here for work or pleasure or for a few days or more.

It was also annoying that the central air was clearly not working as a portable unit had been placed in the master bedroom.  That room was okay but the other bedrooms and the living area were uncomfortable.  If it had been any hotter outside (thankfully their was rain in the area) it would have been unacceptable.

We felt badly that we couldn't spend more time chatting with her as we practically ran out the door after dropping our stuff off to make it to a wedding shower in time and then had to leave early the following morning. The bed was super comfortable. She provided lots of DVDs to watch although we didn't take advantage of them. The shower floor is awesome -- made from stones that feel so good on your feet. She even left us a carafe of ice water by the bed. I have zero complaints. Plus if you like animals you get to meet her charming array of critters -- a couple of goats a piglet and pups. ,Lavishly appointed master bed/bath,4858779,Jennifer

We could not thank Cecily & Fam enough for their warmth and hospitality; their influence on our experience in this city was vast and incredibly informative.
Besides how awesome they were the location and house are both AMAZING!  Cannot stress how awesome the location was for walking downtown through the green belt to Zilker Park to Wholefoods to see bats under the Congress Ave bridge et cetera. (disclaimer: we're NYers and don't mind walking 20 minutes to take in neighborhoods and atmosphere). (PS: Zip car cars also located TWO street blocks away -- amazing!)

Keep in mind if you don't want to bunk up people will have to sleep on air mattresses or the floor. (we left an extra one there enjoy)  The neighborhood is kind of bleh but easy to call a cab and a short trip to 6th street.

When we arrived the house was pristinely clean and just as beautiful as the pictures had indicated. Abianne made everything as easy as possible by making sure we knew the codes to everything and leaving her contact information if we had any questions. She even got local beer and breakfast taco fixings to make our stay that much  more enjoyable. The house itself is awesome. The bed I slept in was so comfortable that I never wanted to leave. The location was also perfect for everything we needed as it is close to awesome restaurants a 10 minute cab to downtown area and close enough to the highway to make getting anywhere in the city easy. Everyone in our group kept saying in throughout the weekend - we hit the jackpot with Abianne's place. It seriously was perfect for us and I couldn't be more happy with our stay!

I would have given 4 stars for a clean comfortable and affordable stay in this house. The 5th star was earned by Ananda being a very gracious host; more on that below.

This is a quaint bungalow in a very scenic and active neighborhood reminiscent of my native Houston Heights. Due to a tipped over crane at my job my friends and I arrived at the house around 1 am! No worries though the door has a keyless entry via security code that was sent to me earlier that day. Disaster #1 averted thanks to owner :)

My time in Austin was filled with a start up conference which ran WAY later than expected during the last day of my trip.

It was within walking distance to coffee and breakfast in the morning and after a long walk back from town in the evening we would swing into Uncle Billy's at the bottom of the hill for a drink. We spent most of out time taking in all that Austin had to offer but it was a great place to come home to each night. Amber had thought of everything from extra towels to take to the Barton Springs Pool to a little grill on the porch if you are inclined to spend more time just hanging out. Why would you stay at a hotel when you can stay at a place like the Suite Spot? We will totally recommend this place to anyone we know visiting Austin in the future.

368156,7739888,10/1/2013,Stephen,I regret that I must give Matt (and Airbnb) a failing grade. Here’s the bright news: Matt is a nice guy his house is great a nice front porch swing and beautiful common areas. The location rocks easy access to running trails 6th Street and good food is literally just around the block (try Chili’s Café on S. First & Annie for the best salsa ever). Why the failing grade? (1) He lost the reservation. Although I had booked his place long in advance reconfirmed shortly after booking and then reconfirmed again about a week before arriving Matt called me 5 minutes before I arrived on foot to tell me that my room was being rented by someone else. (2) His offer to have me sleep in an under-construction bathroom was uncool. When Matt advised about the error I thought for certain that we could find a way to make this work. His first suggestion was offering me an alternative room - what he called the “attic” (photo available on request). It was an unfinished bathroom tucked into the eaves of the house: no flooring no door no finished walls no lighting no anything. The attic will be great when finished but suggesting that tossing down a mattress on the floor beside the toilet was asking for too much flex from a guest. (3) The end resolution unsatisfactory. I ended up staying with a friend for that night because I was skittish about Matt’s second offer to stay at a different house on the opposite side of town. Making sure that I wasn’t charged for the night was too much effort (Airbnb was zero help on this point). (4) I missed the insider insights that usually come from staying local. In other Airbnb-places the host has an insider guide gives a tour of the property explains what is available at the house and elsewhere and just imparts that local knowledge that makes the whole experience cool. Those things were missing here. Even after I got the room I booked (on the second night) the check-in was later than promised there were weird negotiations taking place (such as maybe I didn’t need all the bedding for the room?). If you book here (and I’m not suggesting not to Matt is a genuinely nice guy and his house is great especially for ACL or SXSW) take precautions. Confirm the booking by phone be specific about the time you are arriving and call him to make sure he will be there be proactive at all times if something is amiss and don’t expect Airbnb to assist. Austin is a fun city and having to worry about whether you have a place to sleep is not how I envisioned using my short time there. Even though this is not a positive review I might try Matt’s place again in the future the next time I’m back in Austin.

For the architecturally inclined the neighbourhood is a great area to wander and check out a huge range of wonderful and eclectic homes. Ana was a pleasure to deal with and very responsive. The only reason I wasn't able to give it 5 stars is the proximity to the railway. The trains are quite active including throughout the night.

It was clean small and quiet and it was close enough to Zilker Park and downtown that we never had to get in our truck to go anywhere.  We rode bikes provided by Edie to the festival and all over downtown.  It was a great way to see and explore Austin for the first time.
Edie was a fantastic hostess.  We had everything we needed in the bungalow but she told us if we needed anything (including being picked up because of a flat or some other bike malfunction to just call and she would be happy to help with whatever we needed.  She gave us recommendations for places to eat and places to go out after the shows were over.
We had a fantastic time at ACL and plan to return in the future.  And when we do return we will be staying here again (assuming someone else doesn't book it first)!  The price the location and the bungalow itself make this a place to stay in Austin that would be difficult if not impossible to surpass.  I highly recommend this place for your stay in Austin.

We rented bikes to get further around town but also appreciated being able to walk to tons of great bars restaurants on the east side as well as downtown.  The place is also only a few blocks from Austin's river trail which was ideal for biking as well as for some awesome early-morning runs.  

Having lost my own four-legged friend recently I also really enjoyed hanging out with Friday a terrific and low-key pooch.  Leslie made us coffee and was even cool enough to pre-stock the fridge with beer for our arrival.  I'd definitely stay again on my next trip to Austin.

There were 5 of us in our group and we easily could have fit a 6th.  The whole upstairs was ours which included 3 bedrooms and 2 full size bathrooms.  The beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on.  Vivienne was extremely accessible from the moment I reached out to her to inquire about staying here.  She promptly responded to emails and had a wealth of knowledge regarding things to do in Austin.  When we arrived Michael was there to greet us and get us settled in.  The house was clean the rooms and bathrooms were clean and the beds were amazing.

Each morning we had muffins coffee and orange juice.  And our 2 fridges were even stocked with some equally delicious surprises.  We came for the first weekend of ACL but honestly if the festival hadn't been going on I would have been just as fine plopping myself in front of the TV and watching football all day with Michael.  Location was great for ACL -- only about 3 miles or so from Zilker and same from downtown.  We took cabs a lot but if you don't mind walking a little cool places like Rainey Street were only about a half hour walking distance.

Next time we come to Austin this will be the first place we look to stay.  The only thing better than this place were the people who own it.

Absolutely perfect placement for any activities at Zilker Park. Stayed for ACL  and was able to walk to the festival grounds in 10-15 minutes. Very well kept house. We were the first group to stay at the house so we were missing a few items. Once we called AirBnB they were not only very nice but super helpful. They didn't hesitate to help in any way. The owner showed up personally for the household items that we needed. Very cool guy as well. This place easily sleeps 4 people. The living room turns into another room.

949922,7963266,10/10/2013,Jon,"Such a fantastic getaway with cuteness aplenty.  I visited Austin for a conference and booked this place due to its cost and kitsch.  Turned out I got much more in terms of warm hospitality from Marci & Meredith.  They have a wonderful family and many animals that you'll grow to love roaming their backyard.  

I grew up in San Antonio & visited Austin quite a bit but never spent appreciable time on the east side.  Their location is within minutes of downtown yet I found plenty of great restaurants and bars much closer to their house.  

For an Airstream it was a very comfortable bungalow.  They were smart to install an AC window unit which makes the Airstream pleasant even with the humid heat of South Central Texas.  

Only downside may have been a periodically slow WiFi connection.  Otherwise this place had everything else one would need for their stay.  Couldn't thank them both of them enough.  Definitely marking this place for any return trips to the ATX.

1640231,7972186,10/10/2013,Madeleine,"We came to Austin for a three-day conference and could not have asked for a better AirBNB host or location.  Jamie and Aja's gorgeous duplex has recently been renovated and is very clean and well-kept.  Jamie was accessible and easy to coordinate with.  Upon meeting with her to check in she gave me a detailed list that answered most of the initial questions we had.  Jamie and Aja provided all of the amenities we needed during our stay - an iron a full dish set in the kitchen food in the fridge and more towels than most hotels do!  They even offered to do our laundry had we needed it.  The new bath and shower work better than the ones in my apartment.  Many locations say that they are ""walkable/bikable"" and centrally located but this one really is.  Whether you are coming for a music festival show or for a work function downtown there are sidewalks on several residential streets just north of Cesar Chavez that you can take all the way downtown if you choose to walk or take the bike in the duplex (lock and light provided).  We also took the 17 Capital Metro bus to the convention center one morning and to get to the bars on 6th Street. The 17 connects to bus routes that will take you to South Congress and a number of other districts.  There are dining/drinking options for everyone in the neighborhood.  Overall staying at Jamie's place was the best AirBNB experience I have ever had.  I have already told several friends about this place and will definitely be staying here again next time I am in Austin.",East Side Shotgun Getaway-close2ACC,8708918,Jamie And Aja

- There is a big construction site right across the street and it was unbearably loud starting at 8 AM. Our visit is in October 2013 for reference - definitely check to see if that's still going on if you want to sleep in.
- The shower is a bit small. The water pressure is great!
- We had three people in our group and I think it is more comfortable for two people. The couch was not a pull out and there were no extra sheets/pillows for that person - so just come prepared!

From start to finish Sovay was an absolute pleasure to correspond with responsive communicative providing pages of amazing tips to make our Austin visit more special. Upon arrival at the cottage we were pleased to find how cozy and well-kept the house was not to mention it's convenient proximity to numerous popular locations and activities around Austin. 

The highlights of our trip were a run along the river which the cabin is less than ten minutes from. We loved our visit to Barton Springs in Zilker Park also set right in the cute Zilker neighborhood. We  tremendously enjoyed our kayak rental from the park. The latter were some of the many helpful suggestions from Sovay. As a nighttime recommendation I suggest visiting the Rainey neighborhood. The several block district just off of 6th street consists of old homes that have been renovated into cool bars - Rainy is just a five minute cab ride from the cottage. 

We hope to visit Austin again very soon and we would be thrilled to have another stay at Sovay's Zilker Cottage...

1751368,8013053,10/12/2013,Keith,"If you don't read the rest of this review read this: the listing on here is new but Tony is quickly going to get more reviews just like this. You can't help but want to be around and enjoy the relaxing environment he creates and I truly feel like I got the best of both worlds: business in Austin and a small vacation whenever we got done! Book this property. Stop wondering if you should and do it. You'll thank me (and Tony!) later for the advice!

Tony was an amazing host. There's no where else I'll be staying in Austin if I can help it from now on. He gave us everything we needed (even after forgetting a few items he had spares ready for just that occasion). Tony truly does have the ""host gene""! 

The first morning we were there he fed the whole house with a massive breakfast of strawberry and blueberry pancakes grapes orange juice and a delicious omelette. Talk about a great first morning in the AirBnB!

Every day when we'd get back to the home Tony was working in his studio or ready to talk and relax with us. And by the way I didn't even want to take a picture of his studio. It would pale in comparison to the real thing. It's like you look around and everything Tony is thinking of creating or is inspired by or has created it's on every square inch available. It is a real sight to behold. 

Both of my staff loved the rooms (his daughter's room was amazing too!) and I stayed in the outdoor bungalow (4 nights). It was quite comfy fully insulated private and had a lock on the door if I needed it. 

The backyard is another sight to behold as Tony keeps a HUGE happy and friendly giant tortoise that likes banana peels and other treats. I got to see her on the last day I was there as I was leaving but she had a small home in the backyard that I peeked in on several times. As well there are two great seating areas one on the deck one in the backyard. 

You couldn't ask for a better combination of price location and host. My hunch is that this listing will skyrocket to your favorites in Austin sooner than later. If you're on the fence about the decision don't be. 

Tony and his home was a welcoming place to land after the flurry of activity during the day.  

As well he gave us 16GB of his favorite mixes for the road trip home on a USB drive. So ask him about his mixes :)

His apartment is located in a gated complex with your own parking spot - I felt as safe as can be each night I was there! His place was luxuriously decorated with by far the comfiest sofa and bed I've been on. The shower was a little tricky to use (almost felt like I was gonna rip it out of the wall!) but overall fine. Mark was great enough to provide ample towels and even a bottle of red waiting for us on the counter.

Nathan was very accommodating and met up with us upon arrival. He was really easy to get in touch with and approachable. The apartment is secured by keypad entry for the building and apartment. This was incredibly convenient for us since we had a larger party with people coming and going at different times. We didn't have to worry about sharing a key. Just make sure you have a good memory or keep the code handy! The apartment itself was very nice. Maybe a little small for 6 people though.

We enjoyed talking to her over coffee (by the way-great coffee OJ and homemade breakfast pastries!) about Austin's food and culture.

There were 4 separate bedrooms and a huge upstairs loft - and at least 9 mattresses and I'm probably missing one or two.  I spoke with Becca over the phone twice prior to our stay and she was extremely nice.  The house doesn't look like much from the outside but it is amazing on the inside - very eclectic and nicely decorated.  The backyard which we did not take advantage of is large with lots of room for a BBQ or a backyard get-together.  

The one negative was they had a construction crew doing work to the outside of the house and due to a scheduling error they showed up on Monday morning while we were still there.  Becca was very understanding and even gave us a discount on the rate to make up for the inconvenience - this turned the 4 star experience back into a 5 star experience.

Location-wise the house is a 10-15 minute walk from downtown and the heart of 6th Street.   I'm blanking on the name of the place but the most famous BBQ joint is a 2 block walk from the house - we didn't go due to the line that forms 2 hours before opening but I hear it is well worth the wait.  

Overall a fantastic experience and if we ever head back to Austin for another reunion we will without a doubt be using this house again!",Historic Manor in Downtown Austin,3820555,Justin&Becca

The kitchen was huge with everything you could need.  The new bathroom was excellent with a huge soaking tub and stand alone shower and the towels may have been the softest towels I've ever used!  The swing on the porch was spot on and we used it everyday to chill out on.  On our last day we found a great little restraunt up the road ""Juan in a Million"" nothing fancy just good Mexican food and a cool vibe set by the owner who shakes everyones hand when you walk in..icing on the cake.
Jaime left the keys for us along with some instructions and tips.  She checked in with us a few times and answered everything we asked and even gave us some travel tips that saved us some good time from the airport.
I would definitely recommend her space to anyone and use it again myself.

This is an ideal location particularly if you remain through the last acts each night.  The master bed and bath were great while the living room was a perfect spot to unwind.

My stay at Adam and Sabine's micro house was fantastic. I expected the space to be cool from the photographs but when I arrived I was blown away by how great this place was! It was small of course but also had everything you needed. As I was unpacking I found myself awww-ing a bit because of the items that were left there for you to use. It was more like staying at a friends home and having them set things out for you. This house is situated right outside of the city so driving anywhere was super easy and only took me minutes to get downtown. Adam has his workshop right across the drive so if I needed anything he was there. I couldn't have picked a better place to stay.

The wifi was really spotty though so I wouldn't recommend counting on it if you need to do work while staying there. 

One bone to pick though: we were really interested in the suite because it came with bikes. We thought that would save us money time and hassle. We dide use the bikes to explore town and ride to and from the festival but they are in terrible shape. My bike blew a tube (it happens) but when replacing it the tech noticed that it had broken spokes (dangerous). The other  bikes had worn out brakes loose handlebars and worst of all the hand grips on the bike my boyfriend was riding slipped off while he was going downhill in the rain causing him to wipe out and sprain his ankle. Put a damper on our vacation to be sure. If you plan on using the bikes I would recommend inquiring about whether or not they've had a recent tune or just go rent your own.

He's a big boy and can get in your way since he hangs out on the front porch of the cabin most of the day and because it was rainy all weekend the porch got extremely muddy... Despite that it was a nice stay and if/when Jen makes an appearance I imagine she would be very hospitable.,Tiny House Privacy near Downtown,1907305,Jen

It looks just as beautiful in person as it does in the photos. The property was clean and well-maintained. The service managing the property was prompt in answering our questions. I would definitely recommend this property for a visit to Austin: it's conveniently located to East Austin bars and restaurants and quite close to the rest of Austin too.

528338,8138635,10/17/2013,Chris,"Staying at the Suite Spot was effortless. Amber was always quick to respond to messages and always very friendly and to-the-point.

The area was great! We didn't end up walking many places (because it was raining) but many top-rated places were within a short walk. Few blocks to 1st (and all of the food truck lots). Few blocks to South Congress. 7 min drive/park downtown. 40 min ride to IKEA. 15 min ride to UT Campus. 15 min ride to Slaughterhouse Ln. 

The accommodations were just as pictured. There's room to sit briefly but if you want to stay in very long you may have to lay on the bed. Amber kept coffee and some herbal teas handy. There is a closet to the right of the bed with an ironing board iron and plenty of room to hang up whatever you bring. No dresser to speak of. The mattress was soft and a bit springy. I prefer a more firm mattress but it wasn't a major issue. Just a heads up.

If driving there is plenty of street parking available across from the house. The spots closest to the house filled up after 7:00 pm from patrons of a nearby late-night coffee house.

I only saw Amber and her husband as we were driving off after check-out. They were hands-off as far as we were concerned though happy to oblige if we had any needs. They kept the house stocked with whatever we might need - from extra towels to cooling Aloe in the medicine cabinet. 

Cool little place. Definitely worth checking out.",Suite Spot (Zilker),2595932,Amber

1024819,8169520,10/19/2013,Scott,"The cabin is well outside the tourist/hotel ghettos that travellers often get stuck in so you get a much better sense of what Austin is REALLY like though Austin doesn't put up much of a façade to begin with. It is a bit out of the core but having a bike made it easy to get around quickly. The ride into downtown is easy with well marked bike lanes. Transit into the core is also fast and cheap ($1 or $2 for an all-day pass) and buses come very often down Guadalupe. Most buses have bike-racks too so you can bike into down and get a lift home if you get tired from exploring! Many would be tempted to just head straight into the core but definitely take a moment to explore Guadalupe (the north/south artery into downtown). It has a lot of character too.

Tracy is very friendly. She kindly accommodated my 1-am check-in time and my 4-am check-out time without batting an eye. We only crossed paths once but she texted me a few times to check in and ensure that I was comfortable very thoughtful. The cabin is cozy (and thankfully air-conditioned!) comfortable twin bed and great water pressure. Everything was clean and tidy warmly decorated. 

I have not one single gripe with the place at all. I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay while I was out for most of the day and evening (I was in town for a conference) I always felt good coming back to the cabin.

One note is that the wireless internet connection is a little bit flakey in the cabin so don't rely on it for any mission-critical internet needs. There is a great cafe (La Tazza Fresca) at 37th & Guadalupe that offers up internet but you should go there regardless because the vibe food and coffee are top tier.

We had plenty of space in the bedroom for our luggage and for just relaxing after a long day of exploring the city.  It actually felt like it was our apartment for the weekend which is a great feeling considering we were living out of our suitcases.  The flexibility with checking in and out was extremely helpful as we had no agenda for the weekend and our plans changed slightly from what we had originally anticipated.  It was very easy to communicate with Thien-y throughout the visit to know what the expectations were of us as visitors.  The gated community was a nice perk as we were visiting from out of town and felt very safe.

Daniel also loaned us bikes for an afternoon ride which was above and beyond our expectations and the listing.

As for the guesthouse it faces a lovely yard with large windows and tons of sunlight. Super comfortable couch and living area with a big kitchen. Another nice touch - Daniel left us some welcome food and coffee for our first morning plus fresh flowers - all class.

The king bed is *very* comfortable and the bathroom is nice and clean with a great shower. Overall the house is appointed and decorated very nicely and has everything you'll need for your stay. 

Located in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful trees and landscaping you can walk to S Lamar Blvd and a bit further to South Congress. Tons of coffee breakfast and taco places around as well as some great restaurants.

Daniel has 4 dachshunds and they are very friendly and fun to play with. Lots of laughs as they patrolled the grounds. 

My wife and I would definitely stay at the guesthouse again. For everything you get and the location this is just a great deal for staying in Austin. Thanks Daniel!",Zilker Guesthouse ,213651,Daniel

1681780,8242178,10/21/2013,Jasmine,Stayed here with two of my girlfriends during their visit to Austin. We had such a great time in this little house. It's perfect for 3 people (can accommodate 4 but I think it would have felt a little cramped with one more person). My friends stayed in the bedroom I stayed on the daybed in the living room and we all slept like babies. The little kitchenette is perfect for coffee and preparing light snacks (we made a buffet of wine and cheese and it was awesome) - but there are no cooking appliances so don't expect to prepare any stovetop meals. For what we needed this was perfect. The house is located on a busy thoroughfare so very easy to catch a cab. It's also very close to S Lamar's best restaurants and bars so we pretty much walked everywhere. Also only 20-30 min walk to Whole Foods downtown. Central Air was in perfect working condition so we could keep it cool during the day and heat it at night. And the Turnkey staff was very helpful when we needed assistance with the wifi password.

He's pretty amazing. 

Anyway this couple is even more charming than the place they have for you to stay.  They were so thoughtful. The beds are comfortable the room is bright and colorful the bathroom is clean and comfortable (just watch your toes! There's a small step up and I hit it every time I went in there!)

Further Barbara's suggestions on where to look for housing and where to eat were incredible and man can she make a margarita!

The apartment is in a studio in the back of Gretchen's property behind a house and another small studio. 

I think Gretchen's breakdown of who can stay in the place is accurate. The apartment was very comfortable for 2 and would be ok for 4 who were comfortable sharing the same bathroom. 6 might be pushing it.

I think this place would work better for people planning on late nights & looking to take advantage of its proximity to the bars & music venues.  We were in Austin to eat and explore after a long busy weekend working.  We wanted an apartment where we could relax and were not there for the late-night scene (one of us was pregnant).  As advertised the location in East Austin was great.  It's in walking distance to downtown 6th street and really close to some fun food trucks stores bars and restaurants.  It was also really easy to get everywhere from there by car.  Inside the apartment was decorated cute the linens were clean and Andi was responsive to any emails.  But it was in an older building so the property was somewhat rundown.  We slept rather poorly.  The walls were thin and the truck motorcycle and bus traffic on 6th street was loud all day and sporadically during the night.  Both mattresses were saggy but the smaller bed was creaky & less comfortable than the one in the blue room.  The smaller bedroom was also louder since it was on a corner with 4 windows.  The apartment is also over top of a restaurant/bar.  ,Charming Apartment-BEST LOCATION! A,11349,Alexandria

I travel with a large contingent for trade shows which makes finding a home to accommodate five different people a challenge.  Joseph's home worked beautifully for us and Joseph was a gracious host making a few changes to better suit our needs.
Upon an early arrival - Joseph was kind enough to let us check in several hours early- I was concerned because the home is in a non-descript subdivision tucked off a major highway and from the outside it looks quite small.  Once inside however my fears were allayed.
Joseph has done a wonderful job rehabbing this home with upgraded materials and finishes.  The furniture is comfortable (one of my colleagues thought the bed was too firm but she likes sleeping on big feathery clouds so don't be too worried) and the bathrooms are more than adequate.  The master has a rain shower head in the ceiling which is lovely to stand under but annoying to hear drain for 30 or 40 minutes after you turn off the water. 
And that's about the only thing I can really complain about: a shower head.  Heck I can handle a drippy shower head!
All in all I got a very good price for a wonderfully appointed home that sheltered five of us without any real complaints.  Thanks Joseph!
PS - if you're coming to Austin be aware that they have a ban on disposable plastic bags but the house has an assortment of paper bags in the cupboard.  If you're going to the grocery take one or two with you and do your part to conserve.

69810,8324334,10/26/2013,Kele,"The Casita was the perfect place for my husband and I to stay on our honeymoon trip to Austin. Although we were out and about for much of our trip it was a lovely cozy place to come home to each night. Dolina and Yohan were great hosts (even though we only ran into each other once during the whole week!) and the Casita was well stocked with treats in the kitchen extra toiletries in the bathroom and comfy linens and towels. I found the window seat to be the best perch! The entire space was immaculately clean beautifully decorated and made us feel like we had our own private get-away all at a cost that wouldn't have gotten us into a sub-par hotel room. 

Logistically speaking we were without a car for the week but found it super easy to get around using Austin's bus system. The #10 Metro bus stop is only about two blocks away and runs all the way up through downtown Austin and into the northern University of Texas campus area and an unlimited day pass for the bus system is only $2. The first day we walked into downtown since it's only about two miles away and we did a lot of walking throughout the week since so many things are nearby. We did use Yellow Cab to get to and from the airport and once to go out to dinner and they had no trouble finding us and were very reasonable. We were able to access tons of shops restaurants and activities and found the Casita to be central to everything we hoped to do!

Even the fact that she had no chance to check us in by herself she made us felt really welcomed there. Everything was set up for us as she promised! Apartment is really sweet very-very clean and cosy and looked exactly like on pictures. She not only left us lots of food ( we were coming really late so had no chance to do any groceries) she also left us some suggestions about where to go and what to see which we weren't be able to find without her. Moreover she was very discreet about one particular issue that made me think of her as a very sensitive and understanding person!

He was clear and concise in our communications about our stay and he responded quickly to our requests (where to eat breakfast and access to wine glasses).  His rental space is new clean neat efficient and cleverly divided into 2 separate yet connected spaces.  We are big fans of minimalist aesthetic and so this place suited us to a T.  It would be perfect for 2 friendly couples 4 singles or a family of 4.  Eric was also appreciative of our feedback to add a shelf in the bathroom.  We also loved the location!  Perfectly convenient to everything we wanted to do (eat good food see interesting neighborhoods explore cool shops walk at town lake).  If we hadn't had our baby with us we'd have enjoyed taking advantage if Eric's generous offer to use his 2 bikes.  All in all - we'd definitely stay here again!  a note to patents with small kids: the concrete floors in this space made for easy cleanup (we've got a spitter-upper!) but also made us anxious about falls (our little guy is just learning to sit up) - not a deal-breaker but if you bring little ones consider bringing an activity mat of some sort.,Bicycle bnb in South Central Austin,8716539,Eric & Erin

In case you don't want to read the whole review though here it is in a nutshell: the bed is extremely comfortable the layout is super cool & modern (feels like you're in a show room but comfortable) it's immaculately clean super quiet (didn't even notice the train) it has an incredible shower and it's literally right in the middle of all of the cool Austin bars! This is by far the biggest value I've found on airbnb so far - it was like staying in a fancy design-focused boutique hotel but without the fancy boutique price - definitely a hidden gem!!! In fact the price was so good and the pictures were so great that I was a little bit weary that it was a scam at first but their place is just as amazing as it looks in the pictures if not better! 

Furthermore Tim is one of the nicest and most helpful hosts. He replied to my initial inquiry within 10 minutes and was instantly responsive from there on out. I was in a bit of a bind looking for a place last minute and even though he and Audrey live on the East Coast Tim made arrangements for me to pick up the keys and get in within hours of my initial inquiry. He also sent me a very helpful welcome email with a PDF of everything I needed to know about staying there.

I was in Austin helping out with a wedding and this couldn't have been a more perfect experience. If I ever return this is hands down where I will stay! Thank you Tim & Audrey!!!

Thoroughly modern immaculately clean incredible views from the bedroom and from the top floor deck (which has chairs and a table).

She responded right away when I told her I could not log onto the internet and she was helpful in recommending some yoga studios a bus ride away.
Her studio is spacious and I was able to sleep well enough on the firm futon.
I was in town for a wedding and I am sure Sevylla would have provided clothes hangers for my dress had I made the request but I was able to drape the dress over the chair by the desk. I used the desk to pile my clothes on top and the other chair to drape other clothes on.

It rained really heavily on my second night resulting in the roof of my room leaking in. Water got onto my phone and iPod but luckily they weren't damaged. 

Joseph wasn't there to meet me when I arrived after a very long day's travel from LA which was disappointing as there was no one else in the house when I arrived at 8pm. Joseph eventually arrived at 10pm. Joseph sent me an email (which I couldn't read because I had no internet access). In the email there were no instructions as to what to do when I arrived or where I was staying. It's worth noting that the house was in complete darkness. I saw Joseph briefly the next morning and never saw him again before I left.

The apartment is down an alleyway in what seemed like a safe neighbourhood. It was quite warm so most of the windows in the apartment were left permanently open. However this meant that it was pretty noisy due to all the neighbourhood dogs and the building works going on nearby (which started really early in the morning even on the weekend).

The house itself is very spacious with a good deal of helpful information at your fingertips whether it be a map some flyers from local restaurants or the wonderful recommendations from the extremely helpful Ananda and Dunstan. 

We were quite fond of the ceiling fans in each room and having a fully functioning house so if you wanted to cook in or simply break open a bottle of wine and play games you could with ease. The two bedrooms are separated by a bathroom so you have your privacy. Having a Roku in the living room was wonderful for when we just wanted to relax and catch up on a show or two. 

We often found ourselves walking up the street to have a nightcap or to grab a few groceries. If you need to drive (although a bus is just up the street) to downtown Austin it takes about 7 minutes or so.

Here's what you'll want to know before booking:

As of Oct 27th The Cottage is adjacent to a construction site there is a junk car parked in front to the house (the owner's -- wrecked and with a flat tire) the porch light doesn't work the stereo doesn't work the TV remote works about half the time. The fridge wasn't cleaned out before we arrived. Bathrooms are accessible only through the bedrooms. Dog run in the back is missing its door.

Back patio is a nice touch. Neighborhood is great. WiFi worked well. One of the showers is really good. Price is good. Location is fantastic -- new part of Austin for me that I really enjoyed discovering.

Of course I read all the other reviews before I booked the Cottage. Maybe if I'd reached out to Kat about the things above we'd have found her as responsive and excellent in fixing problems as others did. I expected these things not to be issues when we arrived. 

I was able to drive past the house a week before our sublet and was surprised to see the construction site (mud pit plastic fence-wrap outhouse) right next door. When I emailed Kat about it she said she hadn't even noticed.

I was in town for the Austin Film Festival so know that if you stay at Troy's and don't have wheels it means taking the bus downtown - about six miles. And buses in Austin don't run with the frequency they do in other major cities (about every half hour). It's not a long ride but you're certainly not close to the center of the action. This fact was more than made up for by all the things I've mentioned above. Also it's about a 15 minute walk from Troy's house to the nearest bus stop.

1529416,8443771,10/31/2013,Tamar,We were in Austin for the Austin Film Festival and the location of the condo was awesome!  We were just a couple of blocks from most of the AFF theaters and conference venues and all the dining/nightlife Austin is famous for.  Since we didn't have a car during our visit we really appreciated that the CapitalMetro bus to/from the airport ($1 per person each way!) stopped within about a block of the condo.  The main drawback was that it was pretty noisy-- lots of downtown construction revelers and the building itself isn't well sound insulated so it was very easy to hear neighbors in their condos upstairs courtyard conversations all the passersby on the sidewalk and of course traffic.  It is a ground floor condo (window blinds mostly stayed shut) but we felt safe given that the complex has access gates as well.  The condo was nice and clean and the kitchen was appointed for more minimal food preparation.  That turned out to be just fine for us because we ended up indulging in many of the nearby restaurants for our main meal of the day and just doing breakfast/lunch there.  There isn't an actual grocery store nearby but at one point we made the trek on foot to Whole Foods for supplies (about a 25-minute walk each way).  We had some trouble with the internet connection and with getting the dishwasher to work (we had no idea there'd be a wall switch to control the dishwasher's power!) but Erica and her team were available and responsive when we called for assistance.

347736,8448960,10/31/2013,Cian,We spent two nights at Jason's apartment in late October. The apartment itself is exactly what it looks like in the photographs. The apartment was extremely clean and Jason left bottles of water and coffee for us to use which was a nice touch. The apartment is beautiful well air conditioned and it is a five minute walk from the bars at 6th street. We found it very convenient especially given that Jason had secured parking spaces for us to use inside the premises. Jason's instructions and mini-travel tips for Austin were easy to read and were very useful. Jason was also contactable at any time. I will definitely try to stay here when I come back to Austin!

The location is great esp if you have a car – an easy drive from downtown and close to SoCo Barton Springs and tons of great restaurants.

Alexis made sure we had everything we needed - and I mean everything. After a long day of traveling we walked into her apartment with snacks a cute note and travel guide waiting for us!  She also had a first aid kit sunscreen insect repellant and even bags to bring to the farmer's market; really you name it and it was there. The place was extremely clean and well kept and Alexis checked in regularly to make sure we were comfortable and to give us the update on things like parking changes to let us know to move our car. She really runs this like a business which we really appreciated. The location is within walking distance of nearly everything. This made for a great first experience with airbnb and we can't wait to book our next trip to Austin.

There is a large bedroom with queen bed lots of closet space and a super bathroom that has an amazing shower and a huge soaking tub.

587572,8441476,10/31/2013,Samantha,We stayed for a month and had a wonderful time. This was a bit of a unique situation as we actually rented the apartment from the previous owner and stayed in it under Andrews ownership. The place itself is absolutely impeccable. Spotless and very well located. Andrew was easy to communicate with via text messaging (as he lives out of town) but there was an on site property manager who offered his hand and help the very day we arrived. You get exactly what's pictured and the descriptions are quite accurate. The bed was magnificent. So comfortable with lovely bedding. Most everything we needed in the way of basics (linens bathroom necessities etc) and appliances were available to us and of very good quality. The neighborhood is very quite safe and somewhat walkable by Austin standards. You can hear a train periodically but I do quite like that and for those that don't earplugs were provided. I'd recommend this place for young couples and people in town for partying. Thanks so much for making our stay so comfortable and easy. ,"The Austin ""Get Away""",7976770,Andrew

The location was perfect for me.  It's in a quiet neighbourhood to the East of Austin.  I had a car and found it easy to get around.  It was also easy to find and Belle had left clear instructions for how to access the house.

The first thing I'll comment on is the bed.  It was super super comfy.  Needless to say all the sheets and pillows were soft and clean and the wood the house is mostly made from left a lovely sweet smell in the air.

The other thing is just how incredibly great value this is - I had the luxury of the downstairs living room too which was nice for doing a bit of work in the mornings.

The bathroom more than met my needs.  Some have said it's small - well I didn't notice.  The water was hot and the shower was powerful.

I love using Airbnb to support local people instead of chains and see this as my main reason for doing so.  I still like the privacy of having a personal space while travelling.   Belle was welcoming when I got there and then left me to have fun in Austin.  She was very friendly though and I expect if you wanted to chat some more she'd do so!  I was way too busy and having been in Austin before knew what I wanted to see.

It's a cozy little place with enough space to stretch out without feeling cramped. I slept with the windows open most nights (in mid-October) and it was very comfortable. It even smells like cedar in the Tiny House which is pretty nice. I stayed over a week and was comfortable the whole time.

There is no attached bathroom which is fine if you don't mind hoofing it through Jen's house--and she is about as laid back and cool as can get so there's no worries there.

Demetry the dog is a real energetic hound.  He's a Doberman but as Jen says ""A chihuahua trapped in a Doberman's body."" And that's true. He's super friendly doesn't bark at you and is absolutely addicted to playing fetch with his ball. Since he's a dog he poops in the yard so just watch your step if you're coming back at night.

The house is on a quiet street so I felt fine leaving some luggage strapped into the back of my truck. Takes about 15 minutes to get into the center of downtown with moderate traffic. Easy enough.

We did not need a car though we did rent bikes for two days. If you decide to rent bikes research ahead of time where the bike paths are as many streets do not have bike lanes. If you are sticking to the central neighborhoods of Austin you can get around with public transportation for sure.",Tiny House- Best Central Location!,5181843,Amy

Everything from the actual design of the house to the interior details are so well thought out and a pleasure to call home for a few days. Andrea and Roman were both so gracious in wanting to share about their home towns and gave us customized recommendations to local spots. The room is actually a separate wing of the main home and is totally private and it feels like your own secluded studio space. My only comment is that the loft bed does not have any guard to give a sense of security while sleeping on the loft.

All in all great spot to experience the east side of Austin!

The location was so convenient to the bus stop we were able to see a lot of the city with just the bus and walking. We appreciated the detailed instructions and recommendations too. We did take a few cabs and super shuttle and everything worked out fairly easily. The $1 airport shuttle didn't run early enough for us to catch our flight home but we took it when we landed. 

The Buzz Mill being right down the street was perfect! Where else can you get coffee drinks BBQ and music in one place? 

We really appreciated the water in the fridge because we walked so much every day. That was a nice touch. We were out the whole time so we didn't end up using the kitchen much but liked that we had it.

The buses were really easy to navigate (and take cash! a wonderful practice that I am not used to in NYC) and the restaurants within walking distance of the bungalow were really delicious (i.e. Habana and Opal Divine). I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a really nice place to stay in Austin for an EXTREMELY reasonable rate.

949922,8616340,11/8/2013,Johanna,I stayed a night solo in November. Marcella was lovely as was the the whole family including all the adorable (and quiet) animals in the backyard! The trailer had all the amenities I needed to be comfy (including really nice fluffy towels) and it was a much-needed quiet getaway for me after a very busy trip. Marcella was very communicative throughout flexible warm and accommodating. She even gave me a ride to the bus station when I needed to depart a day early! On that note I should mention that I found this place to be highly accessible for non-car folks like myself (I went to a concert that ended quite late in the evening and was still able to easily catch the bus home) and the bus fare is incredibly reasonable in Austin which helped me trim my travel budget.,Vintage Airstream in East Austin T,5152543,Marcella
1173760,8609635,11/8/2013,Liberty & Chris,"We loved our stay at the South Austin Sky House! Ana met us when we arrived and was very welcoming and helpful. We were happy to meet Lou the cat as well who is such a sweet little guy!

The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed. The screened in deck was wonderful and we slept really well. I was a bit worried about the train as I'm a light sleeper but I didn't even notice the noise at night. Ana was kind enough to let our friend stay one night as well when his accommodation plans fell through.

The location of the Sky House is ideal. It's a short walk through a charming neighborhood to the center of South Congress. It was great to be so close to the fun shops bars and restaurants but still in a quiet neighborhood. It's also very close to the Bouldin Creek Cafe which we loved!

70659,8621192,11/9/2013,Belma,We recently stayed in Sarah's cottage and while there are some very nice things about it sadly our experience wasn't as overwhelmingly positive as everyone else's. Positives: the cottage is cute and nicely decorated with a really nice bathroom (great shower!) and a comfortable bed. It's also quiet well located and with easy access to the rest of Austin and beyond. Negatives: the WIFI is almost non existent. When we did manage to connect the signal was so weak it took a long time to load just a single page. As international travellers who can't use data while roaming and rely on free WIFI this was very frustrating especially as the property is advertised as having internet. The cottage could also do with some dusting / cleaning. It wasn't too bad (the main things i.e. bathroom / bed were clean) but things like the fridge shelves floor etc. needed some attention. And finally we also found the host unresponsive and not particularly helpful. This again seems different to other people's experiences and perhaps there is a reason but it was definitely disappointing. A message I sent before arrival was never answered. When we arrived there was an email from Sarah but it was just to tell us to check out at 11 or if we could check out earlier to let her know. I replied to this with our check out time and also asked if we could borrow two wine glasses - again no response. I sent her another email the next day. This time she replied saying that she'll lay out two glasses for us - but they never appeared! As she was at home throughout our entire stay (although we never met) I'm not sure why it was that difficult to put two glasses into our room. I know this wasn't a hotel or a professional B&B but I wasn't expecting to be ignored (which is never a nice feeling!). So all in all unfortunately we will be looking to stay somewhere else next time we're in Austin.,Private Cottage-Near UT/Hyde Park,359112,Sara
1133017,8621876,11/9/2013,Abi Saafir & Aston,"We had a lovely wonderful stay in Mickie's Gypsy Caravan. It was my birthday and my girlfriend (soon to be wife) treated me to a week in Austin plus tickets to WNYCs Radiolab live at the Bass Hall.  But our nights in the Caravan were by far the highlight of our stay. It was peaceful and cozy. The decor was magical. The lighting was beautiful and the colors were vivid. She left a lovely Stan Getz record on the record player and incense to burn on the counter.

It got cold and it was raining when we got there. When we left the trailer and came back Mickie had swapped the small heater for a big one put down stepping stones so our feet wouldn't get wet and improved the gate latch to make it easier to get in! She was more than helpful - she was Johnny on the spot. 

The bathroom puts most hotel bathrooms to shame. It's spacious and lovely: you feel like you're encased in a jewelbox. The claw foot tub is huge and comfy and she left wonderful bubble bath out. Just don't take too long a shower because the water heater is tiny.

Mickie's Caravan is at the tip top of our list! We are fully prepared to move in with our fluffy cat. (Because every Gypsy Caravan needs a cat.) 

Thanks Mickie!

For starters the decor is incredible the place could be in a magazine. It's mid century modern meets Texas and the light is gorgeous I had a hard time tearing myself away to leave for the day! The pictures on this site are good but it's even better and feels bigger in person (very roomy for someone coming from NYC). Second the location is really really great. I had stayed on South Congress during a previous visit but Gretchen's location is better. I loved being able to walk to South Lamar South First AND South Congress. I felt like I saw much more of Austin than I had previously. In fact I did the whole thing on foot without renting a car. When I wanted to go further afield the bus system was a snap and one of the major ones stops 30 seconds from her place. I am a serious walker and I did also walk to the bars and coffee shops in East Austin as well as to the Broken Spoke. Lastly Gretchen is a very warm and friendly host and it was great talking about Austin with a native. Bonus: her dogs are adorable and well-trained and this is coming from a ""cat person.""

1641751,8631890,11/9/2013,Allie,I only stayed at the Bicycle BnB for two nights with a girlfriend but it was perfect for us! It was really easy to check in and when Eric arrived home from work he helped me with the bikes and told me to let him know if there was anything I needed. This space is definitely big enough for up to 6 people even though there's only one bathroom. Plenty of clothing storage space and lots of natural lighting which I really like. The only thing I would recommend to Eric is to get some sort of heating fan for the winter months. I was cozy enough at night with blankets but since the floors are concrete I would suggest for the winter having some sort of warming unit in the place. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and Eric was very helpful. The waters in the fridge were a definite plus since I don't trust tap water anywhere except Manhattan.

We cooked all week long (except for exploring food trucks) and the colorful kitchen had everything we needed.  Ruth was incredibly considerate too -- we were traveling with our one-year old and she put childproof locks on all the kitchen cabinets it made for a really child-friendly and anxiety-free time in the house since we could have our one-year old roam freely.

One caveat- the location is just off of a main arterial.  The building is tucked back from the street quite a bit but you can hear traffic on 1st street a little so if you're a sensitive sleeper keep this in mind.  (It wasn't an issue for us.)

Good location - a short (10 min) drive / taxi ride from just about every point of interest in Austin.  Location feels very safe / “neighborhoody”.   Walking distance to Franklin BBQ (worth the wait!) & a couple other spots.    

Plenty of room allowing you & your fellow travelers to have personal space & privacy.  It certainly beats squishing into a small hotel room especially if travelling with friends.  

Lastly Stephanie is very friendly & quick to respond to all communication.  

Definitely recommended!

Their home is located a very short drive (10 minutes) from downtown Austin and the University of Texas on a quiet residential street with plenty of parking. Our only word to the wise is that the lofted bedroom has big beautiful windows that look out over the backyard so that it feels like sleeping in a treehouse -- but those windows don't have curtains so you'll wake up with the sun.

321636,8686134,11/12/2013,Anna,Sara & Jay (plus Crash & Darby) were absolutely amazing hosts and I had a wonderful time staying in the Spartanette. The experience was pretty much everything I could have hoped for from arriving to find fresh mint & flowers in the living room to a fridge stocked with beer to the colorful and cosy wool blankets on the bed. I especially loved that Sara was available by text anytime I needed her but the trailer and backyard were all mine. The entire time I felt like I was at a private spa retreat only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Austin but able to just get away and chill at the trailer as much as I needed. I can't wait to go back and visit again!,Chic 1953 Spartanette Guesthouse,1647037,Sara
368156,8693629,11/12/2013,Claire,"I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend this place to others. It's a really lovely house and the location is perfect IMO: you're literally right behind South Congress (which incidentally was a much nicer place to go out than East 6th St!) so a few minutes walk from various restaurants/bars etc. There's also a bus route there that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes. You can walk there in about 30 minutes.

I didn't see too much of Matt but he's a really friendly and helpful host should you need any advice or have any problems.

I had room B which was comfortable and clean - as was the en suite bathroom. It might be worth noting that this is downstairs next to the communal areas (kitchen/lounge/laundry room) so if you're a really light sleeper this is something to bear in mind. I didn't have any problems with this though as the other guests were really considerate when I was there :)

Chris was a brilliant host picking us up from the bus stop and showing us around the area. The location is incredible metres from plenty of amazing restaurants and shops in an eclectic part of town with a great atmosphere. The cottage itself was very comfortable oozing with rustic charm and Texan personality. The fridge stocked with boutique beers and free snacks was a cheeky bonus. We loved our stay and highly recommend the Austinville Cottage.,The Austinville Cottage in SoCo,740347,Chris
1130450,8713383,11/13/2013,Melissa,Gorgeous spot! My husband and I were in town for a Wedding and we were so lucky to have found Trudy's bungalow. The scenery is beautiful & the bungalow is amazing. The design & decor is awesome. I would love to have that bathroom in my home! We had privacy which was the best part. Trudy was available if we needed her but we were given space to enjoy our time away from home. Beats out my past hotel experiences by far!!! We never ran out of towels coffee or toilet paper. The best part is Trudy has a binder full of local resources right there for you to use. Thank you so much Trudy for making us feel at home!!!

68130,8718147,11/13/2013,Diana,Drew definitely is a Superhost! I asked him if the apartment had a guidebook a few days before my arrival and he ordered one for us to use. Check-in was easy. Even though we arrived later than our original plan Drew was very warm friendly and enthusiastic. Without us asking he gave us a tour of the apartment and his recommendations in the city since we've never been to Austin before. We loved Ginny's chicken sh!t bingo that he recommended as well as his tip for saving us 2-hours of waiting at Franklin's! True to the photos the apartment was clean (smelled very minty) with Dr. Bronner castile soap in the shower for your use. He provided us with a space heater which was useful since we were there during the cold spell. They no longer have chickens though so we didn't get any fresh eggs but there were plenty of good food options in Austin. We liked that Drew gave us our privacy and texted us to check-in on how our stay was going (even giving us driving tips for avoiding traffic). Our three-day stay was too short and I regret not having time to check out the Yelp link that he made on the surrounding Hyde Park area - we finally drove up Duval on our way to the airport and saw all the spots we could've walked to from the apartment!,Hyde Park Flat - Bamboo Floors,336916,Drew

Located right beside Barton Springs and a short cab ride up to 6th and Congress or South Congress you're really in a superb location to do a bunch of the things you need to while in town. This place is super clean and Amber is a fantastic host. This is an ideal spot with plenty of place for a single person or a couple. It was a bit tight for 2 guys to be sleeping here but we had a feeling from the pictures it was going to be that way. In any case we really enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend Amber's place to others. ,Suite Spot (Zilker),2595932,Amber

We went down to Austin for one night on Saturday with the intention of going out to 6th street for the evening and once we arrived at Michael's place we saw what a little oasis it was and we didn't even go out. If you're in need of a quiet relaxing place to decompress and forget your troubles this is the place for you! The garage apartment is very clean and cozy with a great kitchen stocked with all the utensils you'd need to cook with (we got up Sunday morning bought breakfast food and made our own breakfast there instead of going out). I can't decide which feature about Michael's place is my favorite but If I had to choose it would be the enclosed outdoor shower (don't worry there's also a normal shower in the restroom inside). Michael Ann is the perfect host - very welcoming and she always responded in a timely manner to all of our questions. She is a wonderful person with a refreshing free spirited attitude and I'm so glad to have met her. ,Beautiful Backyard Garage Apartment,2536590,Michael Ann

Plus their record player and collection were the tops. The location of the house was perfect not close to the hustle and noise of the city but close enough to downtown and nearby shops and restaurants/food trucks.

Clear and concise instructions on what's available (such as wifi) and what we need to do before we leave. Location is just far enough away from downtown that we don't have to deal with the hustle and bustle when we woke up or when we were going to bed yet it's close enough that we walked to downtown instead of driving on several occasions.

The dogs were sweet and made us miss our dog back home. We didn't get the chance to meet Michelle since we were out and about often but we did bump into  John and he was very nice.

Host: ++ Esteban and his family were welcoming easy-going quickly responded to a couple of our requests but also respected our privacy a great experience!

Guest House (outside): ++ located in the back of the property it is secluded private cozy fenced off from the main house and neighbors with a two-section patio plenty of space to do a barbecue savor a glass of somehting tasty and the fresh air :)

Guest House (inside): + very cozy but also modern and recently remodeled clean perfect for a couple romantic even plenty of drawer space a mircowave and a little fridge comfy bed nice big shower; - on the small minus side there was no closet/place to hang clothes and the sofa was not really suited for sleeping and did not unfold. I think a small TV would be a good addition to the room as well. We were two simple guys so none of these things were a major issue for us. Esteban loaned us an air pad which was perfect for sleeping on the floor. But I figure I mention them as a suggestion for improvements :)

Main Yard: + very green lush vegetation on the yard feels very natural you almost forget you are in the city; it was also easy to walk from the driveway to the guest house without disturbing anyone.

Neighborhood: ++great locaton green quiet neighborhood very close to Zilker Park SoCo and Downtown awesome if you like to relax and do the city thing on the same trip.

Note: pool / spa are unheated!  We were rather hoping to use them but Austin weather was definitely not cooperating.

Beds are very comfortable lots of clean towels and dish rags.  Good sized kitchen.  Whole place was clean.  Kitchen could do with a few more utensils - no strainer for example (that I could find) - but overall has everything you need.

Guest bedroom had a curtain rod that was not affixed and fell down easily not ideal after long work days.  Apparently this was an improvement upon zero curtains prior to arrival but would have hoped for secured curtains (and also a bedside light) for the amount of $$ paid for the rental.  This was noted to Dallas and I'm sure will not be an issue for the next rental.

The wifi / router went down - major issue given we were there for work.  Dallas was extremely available and communicative via email and despite being out of town and only flying in that night we had a new router as soon as he touched down.  Very impressive.

From the moment we contacted her she gave us all kinds of information and recommendations to make sure our stay in Austin was a great time. Her place is very well located convenient to public transit and just a short drive from the coolest neighbourhoods in the city. She had fresh chips and salsa and even a pineapple ready to welcome us (you know that's right!) four different varieties of coffee teas hot chocolate and a fridge and cupboards filled with food for our use. She thought of absolutely everything; if you happened to forget any toiletries (or only had a carry-on and couldn't take razors on the plane like me) the bathroom was fully stocked with everything you might have needed saving you a trip to the store. She even had ear plugs available for those heading to COTA (again us) umbrellas light jackets water bottles a cooler... I'm sure I'm forgetting some things which just goes to show how completely covered you'll be if you come here :) As for the room it was spacious clean comfortable had funky decoration and the bed... what can I even say about the bed? It's the most exquisitely comfortable sleep you can probably get in all of Texas. She has a herd of lovely pets (three cats and a dog) who were so friendly and cuddly it really staved off the homesickness for my own kitty :p.

1080704,8898021,11/25/2013,Evan,"Wow. Where to start? This was our first AirBnB experience so my girlfriend and I now have some incredibly high standards thanks to Kristen. The condo was in a great location close to campus close to the bus close to the Capitol building and for the price it couldn't be passed up. Booking it was no hassle and luckily we got in on a weekend without Longhorns football goers to contend with. This is all before we got there. 

With a week to go we had the customary checkin and Kristen pointed out that it would be a bit chilly and we should prepare. Little did we know that it was almost historically cold as we ""escaped"" a dark and stormy San Francisco week into a frigid 38° weekend in Austin. Kristen was apologetic the whole time and kept telling us about how we have to come back when it's hot and how it's totally different but we still had a great time. 

The condo was warm and she stocked it with a pound of coffee which we made a pretty big dent in considering the weather. Everything was neat and cozy and was perfect for a short weekend. 

But the best was still coming. When the end of the weekend came our flights were a little off and we were there past the regular checkout time. Luckily for us there weren't any people checking in on Sunday or Monday so she said it was OK to stay and then as we're packing up she shows up to straighten things up and without any hesitation offers us a ride to the airport. We wholeheartedly appreciated the gesture and the ride over was like one last tour of Austin. By the end of it I was ready to plan our next trip right then and there!

Long story short Kristen made us feel so at home after three days of bad weather in a vibrant town and I feel like I'm obligated to take her up on her offer to come back when it's warm. If it works out hopefully we can stay with her again!",Downtown Austin Condo,1648173,Kristen

The apartment was in great condition. Clean and tidy with everything you could ever need to feel comfortable and at home. The beds and linens are lovely and very comfortable.

When we arrived at Tiny House though Amy had a fresh pot of coffee waiting for us. The house is definitely tiny but very well appointed. The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking and Amy had provided coffee milk bread and eggs. There were even a couple beers in the fridge. She has a combo AC/heat unit that was more important than we would have guessed! By cranking the heat and with a small space heater downstairs we were mostly warm enough. Under normal weather conditions I'm sure Tiny House would be very comfortable. As noted in the description the loft does have a low ceiling. Amy has a fantastic selection of games as well as a few books and magazines and some local maps and tour books that were helpful. The only thing I would recommend is that you bring your own music since there's no radio CD player or speakers for your phone/iPod/etc. The neighborhood is quiet (and beautiful!). We weren't able to take advantage of Amy's yard because of the weather but it was very inviting with chairs a fire pit and plenty of wood and plenty of space for lounging.

There was a bus stop a block from her place which was extremely convenient since I didn't drive.  I hiked Lady Bird Lake and Greenbelt (awesome!).  I love Mozarts coffee too - right on the lake. I think Flipnotics had great coffee and was pretty cool too.  Went to a tailgate party and checked out the infamous tacos at Juan in a Million.  Danielle was a great host and her place is sooo cute!  I enjoyed reading on her deck playing the guitar and slept great.  I had access to the kitchen and anything I needed.  There's a corner store a few blocks away that has great breakfast tacos wine etc.  I can't think of any negatives.  I truly enjoyed the entire experience and would definitely stay with her again.

We were all surprised at how pristine the place was when we arrived. We actually felt at home right away with the pictures of Caren and her family not to mention the place was very comfortable for our party of 7.

Arranging our travels with Caren was a breeze as well; the reservation through Airbnb was fast and easy and Caren was quick to reply to all our questions. In addition Caren kept in communication with us before the trip to provide us with details on how to get into the house how to find our way through the house (e.g. extra towels) and even included recommendations on where to go for the nearby grocers or other places of interest.

It was not clean:
There was black dust falling off of the ceiling fans and oozing out of the air vents.
The shower had not been cleaned and there was a black hair ball on the shower floor.
The coffee maker had molded coffee left in the filter holder.
The building is currently being treated for mold.
My adult son found guns under his bed.
There was no place to hang out clothes because the closets were jammed full of stuff.
Carpets were filthy dirty and had not been vacuumed.
We chose not to spend much time there and tried to contact someone at airbnb.  This was not an easy task they don't make it very easy to find a customer service phone number.  I finally was able to contact them when I arrived home and they sent me an email request for my opinion.

Pros:
- Excellent sweet touches like local food & drinks were in the house when we arrived.
- Lovely table set with linens. Lots of towels detergent for laundry blow dryer and even a hair straightener.
- Location is perfect access to S 1st and Congress plus easy highway access to rest of Austin.
- Lots of great seating area. We were a couple with a baby and two friends and we had plenty of lounging space.
- Georgia was extremely polite and friendly.

Cons: 
- We thought we had a working double oven but found out on Thanksgiving day that the oven was turned off (there was a sign inside but nothing on the outside nor was it mentioned).
- We killed 4 cockroaches last week in various rooms. My husband was concerned about this in part because we have a baby.
- We weren't told about how to get into the house until the day of our arrival; most hosts give directions ahead of time and it was a bit stressful not to have them until last minute.
- This is more for guidance: the master bedroom was a lot colder than the other rooms so select your rooms based on temperature preference.",Comfortable home close to Downtown,3475096,Georgia

When we wanted to do things together there were these great sitting areas upstairs and downstairs as well as on the upper deck....felt like we were sitting up in the trees with the birds. Then when we were needing space it is designed to feel like two separate apartments one upstairs and one downstairs. It is great to have that luxury...and having the mini kitchens both upstairs and downstairs gave us a chance to have coffee on our own in the morning. I really appreciated that. The entire place is light and feels clean no clutter...just (website hidden) upstairs and downstairs was nice and super easy way that they did private entry code and wifi code. The place was full of little gifts...both mini fridges had nice surprises candy on the bed tables and the toiletry items were so nice that we went on amazon and ordered some for ourselves before we left.  The neighborhood is beautiful super close to all that we wanted to do at zilker park and downtown...everything minutes away. We even got good movie tips from Susan and Diane.

He was quick to respond to inquiries and was helpful when we realized we had booked a place with no elevator - 2 of our 11 group had trouble with stairs for medical reasons but we managed! Was really my fault for not clicking on ALL the tabs in the desciption to find where the elevator is not checked on the amenities list.
Kitchen did not have everything needed - was missing large bowls toaster mixer can opener measuring cups baking pans kichen towels (except paper towels were provided) and potholders to remove anything from oven - made for some interesting challenges! The biggest item missing was coffee cups!
Plenty of beds for the 11 in our group (family ages 2 to 54) but not enough living or dining space for more than 5 or 6 people in one area - living room had one couch and one chair that seated 4 at most - there was one additional couch located in the balcony but not conducive to large group gatherings. The living and dining area are open to each other so we could sit 8-9 people and still see each other - just not so good for having conversations. For a condo that has very restrictive noise criteria having a large drum with the two drumsticks on it in the middle of the Living Room with a 2 and 4 year old was a huge challenge - not to mention the bells hanging on the mirror above the fireplace.
Great place to stay if you are just sleeping and want to be close to everything! The fire station around the corner was also a busy one in the middle of the night! We stayed 4 nights - ran out of toilet paper on  second day with only 3 full rolls and 3 partial rolls for 11 people in 3 bathrooms. Weather happened to be in the 40's and 50's - the upstairs balcony got all the  heat and the three bedrooms downstairs got very little heat! There was a fireplace but nothing to burn in it. 
The Living Room TV had been wall-mounted where 2 built-in shelves were removed - the wall was never painted out to match. With 11 people we also ran out of hot water fairly quickly with just showers - there is a oversized jetted tub upstairs that would drain the hot water heater for one person to use! All in all - was a great rental for the price and location - I would stay again and just know more of what to expect! Condo is probably more appropriate for groups just looking for a bed and always out somewhere else for meals and fun. With a few more of the missing details provided I would definitely give this a 4 star!",The Downtown Austin Luxury Standard,4929310,Ryan

Kristi left us detailed instructions for the apartment which was helpful. There were some nice touches---there was wine available and she left many helpful guides to Austin. Just a few things to know if you're a guest-- the walls are pretty thin which isn't the host's fault but that means you will hear the neighbors often. Also the kitchen is not fully equipped with cookware so if you're looking to do that during your stay you might want to bring your own supplies. ,Downtown Austin Texas Condo,1648173,Kristen

Location.
The location is excellent. It is far enough into the neighborhood to feel at home and close enough to still have access to everything. Most of what I had planned was in the downtown area so commuting was a breeze. Austin will always have traffic but here you can bypass most of it. All in all it took about 10 minutes to get to 6th street (about 2 miles for cab) and UT campus. Also about 15 min away to get to Barton Creek mall.

The guest room.
This room was very nice. It has an open layout similar to an apartment studio. Everything in the room is new and top of the line. Definitely a lot of quality. It has a full size kitchen for whatever cooking purposes. Other than that it is pretty straightforward with a bed and couch. The bed was very comfortable. This room has a full walk in closet as well as bathroom. One important aspect of all of this is that this location was very clean. To close it was a very comfortable stay in this guest house.

It was too cold to use the patio but we would have had it been nice outside.  I recommend Nora's apartment wholeheartedly.  Nora is dependable willing to accommodate needs and a sweetheart.  The location is close to everything we needed to do as well as the locations of our other family members. The apartment is spacious clean well-appointed. A very good value especially if you have 4 people staying.  It held all 4 adults comfortably!  Thank you Nora for a terrific airbnb experience.,2/1 Near Dwntwn UT SOCO Zilker,6893843,Nora

I liked Lisa's decor and found her amazing sand collection from beaches around the world enchanting. I've now added some beaches to my bucket list! Since Austin had its coldest weather in a decade during my stay it was great to be in a warm cozy place. Two things that were a bit less than optimum but not a deal killer during the winter: 1- it is a downstairs unit without much direct sunlight so it tends to be dark  2-The outside area and entrance are not as classy as the inside. Overall I definitely recommend staying here!

Her house is beautiful spotless and decorated with paintings from local artists. I stayed in the house with another friend and we each had our own bedroom and bathroom! Totally luxury. It has all the amenities you need and Ish even stocked the fridge with drinks and beer.. and to top it off made us cookies for our arrival!!!

Ish is a great host - she sent us detailed tips beforehand on where to visit and eat/drink during our stay. She would even invite us to local parties and gigs but at the same time she was very mindful of our privacy. We clicked with Ish as soon as we met her so took up her offer to show us around Austin - she took us to local art fairs and we had a wonderful final night out in Austin with Ish and her friends.

Everything ran very smoothly - Ish gave us multiple cell phone numbers to make sure that the meet up would go well. She was waiting at the house on our arrival and gave us 2 sets of keys… the house even has an alarm system so super safe.

We will definitely be back to Austin.. and when we do we hope that Ish's place will be available! It really made a difference to our trip!

Austin was experiencing record cold when I arrived so Tracy switched me to the downstairs apartment with two space heaters going upon my arrival so everything was warm for the entire stay. That was so thoughtful.

The space is fine for two. The furnishings reflect thought and taste.

There is also nifty off-street parking. The outdoor space between the lodging and parking is well-furnished. I was disappointed that the weather was too cold for me to use it but it would be a plus for guests half the year at least I'm certain.

The space was clean relaxing and suited me well. Faisal was accommodating cordial and attentive. My previous plans changed at the last minute and Faisal was prompt in addressing my reservation and within a few hours of the mouse click I was ready to go and set up for a 12 hour post conference slumber.  I was given the space needed to relax but Faisal was clearly there should I need anything interested in the art exhibit and local movie screening I was going to and even offered a ride to the airport.

The Hyde Park area is also very nice and quiet with a couple of restaurants and a supermarket nearby on Duval Street. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this place is the great owners.

69352,9249501,12/16/2013,Eric,"My wife and I stayed at Sovay's cozy & charming cottage for 3 nights.  Overall we found it to be a good place to rest our heads during a fun long weekend in Austin.  Sovay was very easy to deal with during booking and checking in/out.  Though we had no specific purpose on our visit (besides maybe eating tacos for every meal of the day) I can see this being an especially great place to stay during Austin City Limits festival as it is walking distance to Zilker Park.  

We had some bad luck with ongoing construction during our stay.  They were replacing sewer lines in the street right across from the home and it was quite noisy for our first afternoon & following morning.  After that though it was quiet and I imagine this was a one time setback.  

There is a good deal of construction going on closer to South Lamar Boulevard.  You don't hear it when you are in the home but it does make it less inviting to walk to businesses located on South Lamar even ones that seem like a reasonable walk based on viewing a map. (Having said that Uchi is an amazing restaurant less than a half-mile from the cottage and it's definitely worth the walk if you can make a reservation.)    

I would highly recommend renting a car if you wish to visit other parts of town (East Austin South Congress anything near UT campus).  Taxis were extremely unreliable and hard to get in contact with.  You can catch a city bus a short walk from the place but unless you are traveling Downtown you will need to make one or two transfers to get where you are going.  

In conclusion cute place and good service from the host.  If you don't mind driving (or taking buses) to get to other parts of town I'd definitely recommend.  ",Enchanting Zilker Cottage~Downtown,347068,Sovay

The design and decor was just exquisite in every way - we now need to find out the make of the bedding because after we arrived home we realized our bed is nowhere near as comfortable! The location is perfect - so close to South Congress you can walk but on a quiet street so you can escape and feel like you're on a retreat.

Really nice area to walk in and close to Zilker Park Barton Springs and the Botanical Gardens. I found the house to be fairly comfortable although it needs repair work and deeper cleaning IMO.

The bedroom is nice and has a charm to it as well as the bathroom.  The shower is nice and hot.  Electricity went out for a bit.

The people here are nice.  The scenery is unique.  I arrived at night.  People here knew I was coming but it was quite something to arrive in the dark using my Iphone to see around.

This place is definitely a nook in the universe and it's funny how it feels like it's kinda in the middle of nowhere in the wilderness yet it's just a short jaunt from civilization.

Jason was available by call or text for any problems that we could have encountered. Jason also accommodated several personal requests. My fiancé and I had just gotten engaged and Jason provided a bottle of champagne. He also personally reviewed a list of things to do in Austin that we sent him ahead of time and provided suggestions. He even let us use his personal printer when we needed to print off something unexpectedly. Finally we accidentally left our coats in the condo.

368156,9298619,12/19/2013,Sandy,"Matt's house was better than expected. The location is ideal. 

Short walk to all things on S. Congress as well as S. 1st Ave.(5 min.) which I did not even know about. Don't miss this for some great restaurants - Sway Chile Bouldin Creek Cafe and more.

He keeps it very clean - someone came into clean many times in the week. A large equipped kitchen is available - but there is so much great food nearby that we never had a chance. He had coffee avail. for us as well as spring water this was perfect and all we needed. It turned out to be a cold week and rained one day. Matt provided large umbrellas which allowed us to continue our exploring much more comfortably.
 His house is walking distance to downtown parks music and food. Downtown is only a 20 min. walk straight up Congress & with a bus station a short block away if needed. I like to walk alot to explore so could go so many places from here easily. Even if you go further to Zilker Park or downtown and there are buses - if it is a busy event it was great to be able to walk home without having to find a taxi or even wait for a bus. 
Pleasant streets to walk along and Austin is very safe friendly and clean. Also was nice to be able to stop in the The Continental Club on the way home - always great music everyday & night so it was great to hear anyone playing there - approx. 3 different shows a night and The Gallery right next door. Go listen to anyone playing.
Actually we felt like we had the whole house to ourselves - there are 3 rooms but all in different parts of the house Matt was there if we needed him or called but everything was readily available so really no need. He was very nice when we met him and gave us some good ideas. There are also bikes available but it was too cold. Lots of sitting areas in the house and yard.

The bed was comfortable and nice pillows. There is an extra office type room connected to the room (not shown) that was really helpful to have. We put our suitcases there and a counter for our laptop - really good to have this space. We had our own bathroom right next to the room and plenty of towels.
I will definitely stay here again and recommend it for any stay in Austin.
Much better location than staying downtown . Downtown is good to visit but SOCO is better to hang out in.
Matt provides a great alternative to a hotel - and it's a great neighborhood to walk around lots of interesting houses to look at.

Sara was very courteous about guiding me to her location and explaining all the ins and outs to about the airstream. Her space is somewhat of a farmstead paradise. There are chickens quietly tucked away in the yard two lovely pups that are adorable and a huge airstream. I feel like Sara knows how to live.

2011847,9436371,12/28/2013,Kyle,"I was disappointed with these accommodations particularly considering the price. The pictures on the house's listing don't really convey that the room is extremely small (I'd say 6' by 8') or that the bed is just a mattress on the ground. 

Perhaps I should have scrutinized the pictures more carefully but the price ($70 for two people) certainly indicated that there should be more to it. Also it wasn't really clear that it was a shared bathroom. That might be on me as a ""buyer beware"" moment but if I were living there it wouldn't occur to me to rent out any part of the space particularly not at $70 a night.

Some other points: The bed did not have a sheet between the bedspread and the comforter. I'll give the host the benefit of the doubt that he washes the comforter but you should always have a full set of sheets on a bed.

The glassware was not particularly clean and the living room furniture consists of a camp chair. This is very much a bachelor pad.

Baby's needs: a safe place to crawl eat and crap
My needs: close enough to South Congress Street so I could sneak out to a late show at the Continental Club after everyone went to sleep.

The Atomic Ranch met all of these needs quite nicely. Plenty of seating space kid friendly and a 20 minute safe walk (or $7 cab ride) to the Continental Club. It's also 2 blocks from a sketchy-looking but surprisingly well-stocked convenience store (replete with a decent beer selection) and about 6 blocks from a nice brewery.

Angel was easy to deal with---plenty of communication so I knew someone was there if we needed her but not so much that it was annoying. Everything was clean and as described.  Fun and interesting if not luxurious decor.

The only (minor) negatives are that the beds are not very comfortable and the house is on a fairly busy street so backing out of the driveway is a little precarious. We also could not get the TV to display the Roku box but I have a feeling that was operator error.

The Condo was full of personality with all the arts decorations the paint... everything spoke the mind of a free spirited woman. My husband and I absolutely enjoyed living Lisa's life for a few days.

Lisa has a binder with a list of fun places you could try. We found out about the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema from her recommendations and went there. It was a great experience! It was really thoughtful that she listed all the fun things to do with maps.

There were speakers we could connect our iPhones to play music and there was a printer which was handy to printout boarding passes (although we didn't actually use it).

All in all it seemed Lisa had made every effort to make her guests' stay comfortable and convenient. So thank you Lisa!

The house is well equipped and in a good location (probably a ~15 minute walk to get into the main part of SoCo). The rooms were good size and very comfortable. The kitchen is nice and has most of the basic cooking tools you would need for simple meals. We were cooking Christmas dinner so a baking pan and larger skillet would have helped but we made do without them. Also we weren't sure if we could use the long horn grill for actual grilling or not. We decided against it as it looked more like a sculpture than a functioning grill so that was a bummer (but we might have been overly cautious)!
