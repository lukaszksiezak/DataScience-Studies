5769,169182,1/10/2011,Adam,The house was clean spacious and easy to find. Had the weather been better I would have taken advantage of the back patio. The only drawback was the 20 minute drive on Austin's serpentine collection of highways but not necessarily a drawback unless you stat during the week when you have to contend with rush hour.,NW Austin Rooms,8186,Elizabeth
27632,170985,1/16/2011,Mekala,"I stayed here January 9 to January 15 and unfortunately Austin was in the 30s and 40s temperature wise; the heater in the apartment works great!  The rental is in a great location.  For people without rental cars it's on a direct bus line to Whole Foods (I walked there but it's about a 10 minute walk and there are hills) UT-Austin and downtown.

No real complaints except lack of heat during an unusually cold January which Drew remedied with a brand new heater.

69352,173143,1/21/2011,Comet,"Imagine a home perfect in every way for a place right around the corner from downtown Austin and this describes Sovay`s home. 

Sovay's place was exactly as she described. It's in a great location and is an absolute bargain for staying in such a convenient spot. It was clean neat and comfortable. She was a pleasure to deal with and she really made me feel home.

I had my absolute privacy.  Bathroom was private and right next to my bedroom.  There was an LCD TV on the wall in the bedroom but I preferred surfing online on my notebook in the living room.  Cappuccino maker as well as some other small kitchen appliances are brand new for guests service.  If you prefer having your coffee outside you have many options at Sovay`s wonderful suggestions.

Lois was helpful and a lovely hostess.  Between the artwork around the property the the plethora of pillows and blankets and the calmly energetic vibe of the place I would definitely recommend this little gem.

The apt was top notch so clean and comfortable. It  actually was even nicer than the photo's let on!

6251,179429,2/7/2011,Avni,"Location was great! Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The loft was spacious and decorated. One dislike about the loft was that it seemed like the host had recently stayed there. 
Fred was very accomodating to our travel plans and left precious instructions and recommendations!",Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick
68130,179263,2/7/2011,Adam,"Drew and Simone were excellent hosts. Everything was all set for us upon arrival the apartment was clean and we felt very comfortable there. The entrance to the apartment is in the backyard up a set of stairs over the garage and separate from the house.  We felt free to come and go without worrying about disrupting their household.  The chickens and dogs were often hanging out in the yard and always fun to see as we headed out for the day.

We experienced Austin during the absolute freakiest cold spell with below-freezing temperatures snow ice and strong winds.  Our hosts provided a space heater that was portable and efficient with circulating and warming the air in the aparment.  Its good that it is lightweight and portable because we did move it between the main room to the bath room as needed to keep things at a cozy temperature.  I think that most people will not experience this situation since we were there in a ""worst-case"" scenario regarding the weather.

There is a nice flat-screen tv with netflix and pandora but otherwise no channels.  This was preferable to us and we used the netflix quite a bit.  Wifi was also provided and quite useful.

The Hyde Park location was great for us coffee shops & groceries are easy walking distance.  We were there mostly to check out the city and surrounding neighborhoods.  We spent one day walking from the apartment through Hyde Park down to the University Capitol and downtown.  So it is possible to walk all the way downtown from the apartment but it is quite a hike.  If you don't have a car it would make sense to get familiar with the bus schedule for the area or locate a bike.

We would highly recommend this apartment rental to individuals or couples that are visiting Austin and looking for a cozy clean & relaxed place to stay with fairly close access to the university and to downtown.",Hyde Park Flat - Bamboo Floors,336916,Drew
57187,179807,2/8/2011,Michael,"Lois was a great hostess and her place is a true Austin original.  The location is unbeatable and having a colorful private cottage in the Zilker neighborhood to come home to each night was wonderful.  If you need a ""new austin"" hipster spot with an ipod port you can rent a room on Congress for $300/night.  If you're looking for a unique experience that is more in line with the Austin that I grew up with try staying with Lois.

I walked downtown every day and it took only about 10 minutes with waiting at traffic lights.  This is a great little place for the Spring-time temperatures.

I would have given this 4 stars except for the following which were somewhat out of the control of the owner:

My only complaints are that the stove was not hooked up nor were there any pots or pans so cooking my own meals other than microwave meals was out.  It was also abnormally cold in Austin the week I was there and the only source of heat was a nice space heater that tried its hardest to fight off the sub-freezing temperatures outside.  The studio had a hard time even maintaining 65 degrees with the heater cranked.  This also translated to the hot water in the shower which for some reason could not exceed luke warm.  Let's just say showers were exhilarating!",Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

My only regret was that I never had the pleasure of meeting Lois. Our schedules (and my sleep) would not allow it.

With three lovely patios it's hard to choose a favorite but mine would have to be the rooftop area. What a relaxing place to sit and watch the sunrise/set. The house is minimally and beautifully decorated--if I were you I might just leave the shoes at the front door if you're comfortable. It'll save any worry that you'll mar the carpets.

All members of our group just wanted to take the cloud-like beds home with us. Oh my goodness. We wasted Austin sightseeing time because we didn't want to climb out of bed.

When we arrived we were a bit early for checkin and got to meet Angele's husband and adorable little boy who gave us a quick tour of the place. We loved having the wifi and honestly not having a tv was a plus for us. Kept us out of the apartment and enjoying what Austin had to offer. The bed was huge and comfy the apartment was cool in the daytime without the air running thanks to two awesome ceiling fans (remote controlled!) and the storage space for our things was extravagant. The kitchen was beautiful - my husband decided if we redo our kitchen we'll take some pointers from theirs. I felt like I was right at home within about five minutes of unpacking.

75174,200640,3/16/2011,Jason,"I stayed at this great condo on the south of the lake in Austin for SXSW 2011. According to David it had just been remodeled and it looked it everything was brand new and ready to go. The decorations added some personality and I felt right at home. I was pleasantly surprised to find beer in the fridge coffee on the counter and clean towels and linens everywhere.

I was by myself but the place could easily have fit 3+ with its queen bed and pullout couch. There's a really big living-room with an attached kitchen and porch separate bedroom/closet and you can walk down to the pier on the lake in just 2 minutes. It's situated right by a great park where people jog and play sports.

It's about 1 1/2 miles from the convention center/downtown which is a decent walk but there is a bus stop just around the corner which works well too. For something like SXSW it was perfect to be away from all the hustle and bustle and actually get some sleep. Basically - not downtown but close enough for a decent walk - easier than staying in a hotel by the airport and a darn lot nicer.  Cabs work too.

It is plenty spacious and has a lovely (though small) bathroom.

The real pleasure of staying at this place is the backyard which Dan created from scratch. It has grapes growing a back shed full of wonderful folk art that Dan made himself a nice deck with patio chairs to lounge in and a bamboo and cactus garden as well as many hanging plants. It's really a nice place to spend a luxurious afternoon or evening.

This place is better if you have a rental car or bike as it is a rather long walk to and from the closest bus stops where frequently-running buses run and from the main drags (South Congress and Lamar though it is relatively close to S. 1st St which has buses running frequently).

72633,222999,4/11/2011,Penny & Fred,"I highly recommend The Rusty Box!!!  It is a delightful and unusual experience.  It was like being inside of a contemporary minimalist art piece.  And for an artist that is a real treat.  It was a visual and sensual pleasure to move around in the light open space.  The combined design and materials of The Rusty Box tucked under the branches of a huge Live Oak tree in the back yard made it feel like a tree house especially in the master bedroom.

Everything that is written in the description is accurate and much more.  It is a very centrally located and within walking distance of a hip eating and shopping area.  On the corner of the block is The Herb Bar which has an extensive array of natural health and body care products including Texas flower essences.  Also you an get a chair massage.

Becca is an excellent host as she made us feel right at home. She left us wine snacks and breakfast pastries.  She has prepared notes and magazines with information about the area and the house..   Be sure and read the section in the 2006 Austin AIA Homes Tour Book to get more information about Becca and Steve and the building of the house.  Very interesting.

When we first arrived it was about 12:30am and she offered to drive us around the town and give us a tiny tour! We could not believe it!

As soon as you walk in the artwork will have you mesmerized and each is a great conversation piece. The patio overlooked a spacious grassy area and had a nice view of downtown.  Fred is a wonderful host and was very accommodating. You can't go wrong with renting this place.   ,Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

78831,248469,5/2/2011,Mateo,"Marcus went out of his way to make us feel welcome.  We had a late arriving flight into Austin and Marcus stayed up to welcome us.  Each day at least once a day Marcus texted me to ask if everything was OK.  The one time I requested something he accommodated us right away.  The place itself was just what we needed.  It's not fancy but it was very clean and functional.  If you're more into enjoying the sounds and sights of Austin (rather than staying in bed all weekend -not that there is anything wrong with that :) this is a great home base.  Hyde Park is probably my favorite neighborhood in Austin and 'the fort' is smack-dab in the middle of all the beauty.   

There really wasn't a thing to complain about.  However in an attempt to be as honest as possible I will note that - as advertised - the bed is a futon.  It's no problem if you are a rockin' 20-something (after a fun night out you just need a place to collapse right?).  But if you are used to sleeping in a cushy bed keep in mind that we are talking about 4 inches of padding and that's about it.  The room is located in a separate building behind the main house - a big plus if you are seeking privacy.  There is someone living above the room so you will hear occasional footsteps.  However the noise was minimal and didn't bother us in the least.  The upstairs unit opens up to a great patio that overlooks the quaint neighborhood houses and mesmerizing pecan trees.  It was a lovely place to enjoy our morning tea.

There was plenty of amazing local ground coffee in the freezer fresh half and half in the fridge maps and snacks on the dresser and a general feeling like your were being treated more like a family member rather than a nameless guest.  

Oh and after we had checked out my girlfriend realized that she had forgotten a special dress in the armoire.  I e-mailed Marcus the details and the dress was sent to her that day.  Two days and 700 miles later the dress and owner were reunited: what a guy!  I will recommend this place to any friend or family member time and time again.  Thank you Marcus!",Cool Hyde Park efficiency apartment,423840,Marcus

Sovay dropped me off to buy new luggage at a great store only someone with local knowledge would have known about after my baggage was destroyed by the Southwest Handlers. Coupled with the fact she is a wonderful host and let me use her bicycle plus her equally wonderful dogs - it was easily the best place I stayed on my trip to the USA.

Guests have access to a private bedroom bathroom and free reign to the kitchen/living room area. We felt very much at home and enjoyed being able to make use of the kitchen. 

Sovay's house is in a convenient location a short walk to coffee shops bike rental and restaurants on Barton Springs Rd. as well as Zilker Park where you can stroll around swim and kayak. Downtown Austin is not as quick of a walk - especially in the heat - but it's possible and we walked in once. It's much more comfortable to walk a couple blocks to the bus stop and take a quick bus ride downtown.

Unfortunately we stayed busy enough that we never got to meet Sovay - but she was very hospitable and helpful through emails and texts. We appreciated that she didn't mind us coming and going at odd hours.",Enchanting Zilker Cottage~Downtown,347068,Sovay

Her thoughtfulness her small details around the house and her interest about our well being were there all the time. She even left cookies for our little son which he devoured together with my husband. I could not have felt more at home in her little cottage.

1. Drew is a natural when it comes to hosting and making someone feel welcome.
2. They have a great little nook above their garage that they make feel like home to the wondering traveler.
3. Drew offers little tidbits on where to go what to eat etc; which they all check out as great advice. What is also great is he is not pushy with these suggestions.
4. The location is perfect for someone wanting to unwind or just the opposite someone who wants to get caught up in the buzz of the ƒ??localƒ? Hyde Park area. You pick.
5. You are free to come and go as you please and Drew is willing to work with you when it comes to check in and check out. 
6. Drew and his family have a sustainable future in mind and they walk the talk. This coexists exactly with their neighborhood and surrounding area (Austin only).

The cottage is in a great location super close to many bars and my favorite food truck in Austin :) It's a quaint little studio cottage with plenty of space.  Only things to note are that there are no doors not even to the bathroom (separated with a curtain).  So it's a good place for 1 person or perhaps a couple.  It's definitely got the artsy Austin feel to it which is awesome.  Thanks Fiona!,Sweet Sexy Studio in the '02,688306,Fiona

We were welcomed when we arrived and given a quick intro to Austin. We happily accepted the bottle of wine and the bar of dark chocolate that were left for us. 

They thought of just about everything here. Bug spray body wash and even on-site yoga and massage. We got plenty of towels to use. Both indoor and outdoor!  The A/C works quite well (we were there in 95 - 100 degree weather) and there's lots of natural light. The wifi was great and there was a flat screen TV (which we never turned on so cannot comment on). What is especially nice about this spot is that you are not directly above or below the host. The apartment is located above a garage which is separate from the host's house so you have a great deal of privacy which we enjoy.

We are moving to Austin soon and were very lucky to stay with someone who was so open to helping us think about neighborhoods the housing market etc ....

We couldn't have imagined a better airbnb experience!

He worked with my work schedule to find a time when I could get settled into his place which I appreciated.  He even looked up the bus route I needed for me.  The location was well located for exploring south Austin.

Sadly Tyler is new to Airbnb hosting and there were some kinks to my stay.  The bathroom hadn't been cleaned and wasn't cleaned over the course of my stay.  It had a lot of hairs shaving bits and laundry on the floors and counter and a dirty bathtub.  The bed in the bedroom was comfortable but a portion of it sagged so that if you were in bed with another person and were near the edge you had to be careful not to roll out.  He could have also tidied up more of his personal items in his room since there was laundry out on the door knob and stuff falling out of the closet.

The place is located a little far from the downtown core but buses run frequently and with bikes the ride was only 25 mins. Also there is a great coffee shop down the road right next to the 'HULA HUT' which was an unbelievable place to grab some Tex-Mex eats/margaritas on the water.

The relaxed mid-century design mixes seamlessly with modern conveniences: the 1970's stereo/turntable combo in the living room is wired to an extra speaker in the bathroom (great when you're getting ready in the morning) the beautiful wooden mantle is home to an HDTV and the retro kitchen (with reliable well-maintained appliances) includes a microwave and coffee maker.  The beyond adequate bedding in both rooms provided for a sound night's sleep and each room contained plenty of closet and drawer space.  One of the best features of the house is the back patio which had plenty of chairs (both stationary and rocking) and tables perfect for enjoying a cup of coffee while basking in the perfect Austin weather.
 
Merri and Donald actually live downstairs of the house but we never noticed them there at all.  Merri popped up twice to say hi (once at the beginning and once towards the end--with her awesome black lab!) and we chatted like old friends.

The rooms were spotless and well maintained and we had access to a w/d.  We were afforded considerable privacy -- able to come and go without disturbing anyone and vice versa (yes the dogs barked a few times over the course of a week but not odd hours and it was no bother to us).  The cottage was filled with unique and quirky books mementos and knickknacks -- so perfectly Austin.  Having lived in the neighborhood previously we knew going in it was safe peaceful and strategically well situatiated -- super easy for jumping onto Mopac (10 min to downtown sans traffic) and close proximity to places like Russels Kirby Lane Draught House Taco Deli Houndstooth etc. Overall the experience worked out great for us and we heartily recommend this Central Cottage.,Central Cottage with bikes!,378744,Andy & Ellen

It was clean and quite cheerful.  The walls are all a different bright color making it impossible to wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  Fiona was also very quick to respond to my e-mails and greeted us right when we arrived.  She was a great host.

223230,715075,11/13/2011,Michelle,"Staying at Courtney's was my first experience using AirBnB - It was a bittersweet. On the one hand as a mother of 2 young children the comfort of staying in a home was great - kitchen available and separate rooms for the kids. The decoration of the place was nice and quirky. But upon further inspection I noticed that there was dog hair ""everywhere"" - not just the floors but the sofas toilet seat pots/pans etc. This is no exaggeration. In the morning I made omeletes and there was dog hair there too. I knew she had a dog but was assured that the place would be cleaned up for the night I was staying. To top it all off they left the dishwasher full of dirty dishes - apparently so we could put our own dirty dishes in as well and wash them together. Unfortunately it was almost full and there wasn't sufficient silverware for us so we had to wash dishes by hand. Also the kitchen trash was half full. Courtney said in the rush to give us the apartment 2 hours early she forgot to take it out. I can see how that could happen but the combination of all the other things - the general lack of cleanliness - really left me unsatisfied with my stay. It was a real shame because other than that which is a big deal her house was nice. Still at more than $100 dollars a night I expect at least a certain level of cleanliness - dog or no dog. If she isn't into cleaning then at least they can splurge for a cleaning lady before having (website hidden) I'm not an OCD clean freak I have pictures of the clumps of dog hair around everywhere.

The morning came where we had to go. She overslept even though we had discussed a 9 AM departure. She then said ""Oh right you know what... I spent your cash so I'll send it to you in the mail""... We found this totally irresponsible and unprofessional.

She ended up writing us a check on the spot and it did not bounce. The point is she was not a responsible host. A respectful guest shouldn't have to think about whether he/she is going to get their deposit back.

We loved that everything down to the games in the drawers (1960's Ouija board) was in keeping with the period.  The vintage stereo with speakers wired into the bathroom is a big plus and makes the place very vibey.

We were a tad bit skeptical when we saw they live in the back and have a dog as we wanted privacy and quiet.  This was not an issue AT ALL.  We never even noticed they were there as you cant see where they live at all and we never heard their dog bark once.  We met them when we first arrived they were very laid back and their dog was beyond sweet with us and our 2 children.

The neighbourhood is very cute and close to everything - less than 5 mins to South Congress and close to the East side.  Lovely parks nearby for the children to play.

Overall they were very attentive hosts when we needed them and the house was clean comfortable and cozy. We would love to make this the place we stay every time we come to Austin.  Definitely recommend! ",2BR Stylish Mid-Century Town Lake,1018853,Merri Gale & Donald

Me Tony and our little dog hurricane had the most unexpected experience with Belle & family. The guest house was very clean and neat and even tho we arrive late at night Belle was there to great us with delicious homemade Christmas cookies. Hurricane and Martha ( Belle's dog) became friends instantly. 
After settling in Belle's place became very comfortable and home feeling:-). The neighborhood was very quiet and we felt very safe when out walking hurricane.

57187,818050,12/31/2011,Andrea,"first off if you want friendly earthy and artistic to the hilt lois and her home are up at the top of the list.  lois is very engaging and has GREAT recommendations as to where to go - to eat to stroll to hear music - you name it she knows the who and where of austin and especially its creative and funky side.

her home is in a sweet quiet neighborhood parking is easy - right out front - and plentiful and the room we stayed in was in the back so it's private as can be.  there are plenty of pillows for the futon and soaps and towels for the bath so that's comforting.  the room is clean bright colorful and charming and charm is often what i look for in b&b's so that's why lois' place caught my eye to begin with.

so now for the not-so-good part.  my husband and i are middle aged - i'm 49 and he's 59 - and while we're in pretty good shape overall (we came from d.c. for a tennis clinic weekend outside san antonio (which turned out to be brutal but fun!) but we wanted to see austin first.  my husband has a hopefully temporary ankle problem that makes it a little more challenging to deal with futons on the floor.  the futon-only aspect wasn't what i had expected and couldn't see it was that from the photos when i first checked out the listing.

the futon needed to be pulled out and a top sheet put on it by us (i didn't find that top sheet until the next morning when i had a look around).  there was no bed table or bedside lamp so there was no way to read in bed without the overhead light on.  the building that is this one-room retreat space is not actually designed to be a bedroom; the ceiling is very high so the lights are way up overhead and so heat rises too and if it's chilly as it was the night we were there you need to put both the heaters on - i'm grateful they were in the room.  and there were plenty of blankets too so that helped.

quite frankly the bathroom was uncomfortable as it is very small.  the sink faucet is a goose-neck so high above the bowl that water splashes everywhere when you turn it on with any force.  the shower is very narrow so if i was much bigger than my petite 5' self i don't think i'd enjoy it much.

the reason i mention all this is a) it's good to know if you're older and this is not what you're looking for b) the way the room and bathroom are set up is not likely to change so there's no reason to just mention it privately to lois and last but not least c) because of the price.  at $80/night i felt this was kind of pricey for what we were getting.  first of all airbnb is a strange name for listings that don't offer breakfasts and in this case there was a futon mattress (no frame) on the floor instead of a bed so my husband called it a bed and breakfast without the bed or the breakfast.  i went back to airbnb and checked out some other b&b listings in the general vicinity of lois' and found that for the same price a more standard and frankly higher quality of furnishings and services were offered.  sometimes charm doesn't make up for the basics and i guess that's especially true for many of us as we age.

so the bottom line is that while lois is a sweetheart and a total gem of a resource for how to experience austin's progressive and 'weirder' side the room would be much more adequately priced at half the cost and we would have been quite happy with exactly what we were paying for if that were the case.
