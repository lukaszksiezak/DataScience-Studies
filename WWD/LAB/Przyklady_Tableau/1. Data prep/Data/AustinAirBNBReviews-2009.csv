5456,865,3/8/2009,Ellen,"Sylvia is a hostess who is gracious and helpful beyond words! First of all, she wanted to know about our plans and answered all of the questions we had about the city via email before we arrived. She picked us up from the airport and had a handful of maps and magazines about Austin. Her guest house is spotless, adorably decorated, and complete from soap to movies. The neighborhood is charming, and walking distance to cool spots. (We lucked out because her schedule allowed her to show us around the city.) 5 Texas stars!",Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

5456,1039,3/22/2009,Galen,A great place to stay in a great city. Sylvia picked me up at the airport and drove me to Whole Foods so I could buy groceries. She also took me to my first Texas bar-b-que. I saved a ton of money because I didn't have to cab downtown; I could easily walk. The apartment is clean and the bed very comfortable. This place is a lot better than a hotel. ,Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

This lady loves Austin and wants others to experience it to the utmost. Silvia picked us up at the airport, showed us around the city a bit,  and accomodated us beyond the normal scope of hostess. I've already recommended her place to several of my friends. Hopefully, I too will be able to visit Austin and Sylvia again!",Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia
6251,2267,5/10/2009,Anna,"About the place:
The pictures don't do the place justice.  Fred had a maid come through hours before we arrived, so the place was immaculate.  The condo itself looks very industrial, with exposed loft ceilings, smooth concrete flooring, and floor to ceiling high windows.  The decor is very minimalist/neo-mod, which I found very comforting (and easy to clean up after).  There was free WiFi, and I was able to stream my iTunes music onto his home stereo, which I had playing most of my stay.  At $60 a night, and with the going rate of motels in the city at $120+, staying at Fred's was a steal.

About Fred:
Upon meeting Fred, I immediately felt at home.  He is a very sincere, nice, intelligent fellow, with good humor to match.  This is my first time using AirBnB, and I had my hesitations, but Fred quickly washed those feelings away.  He made us feel very welcome in his beautiful home, and for that, we are very grateful.

About the stay:
I never had to call Fred about anything during our whole stay.  In other words, our stay in Austin, went smoothly.  Other than the construction that woke us up Friday (which he warned us about, and will probably be finished by the time he ""rents"" out his place again), our stay went undisturbed.  

Extra notes:
I highly recommend you stay at Frederick's place.  If I ever find myself in Austin again, he's the first person I'm going to hit up.",Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

6251,3051,5/24/2009,Sujan,"Very nice place, that is clean and stylish. Full kitchen with utensils and modern equipment. Easy-to-use, washer-dryer on site as well. 

Good neighborhood and close to downtown area. Close to local/Latino places to eat including an El Salvadoran place (El Zunzal) that was excellent. 

The construction was the only hassle since all windows had to be shut at all times (taking away the awesome view of downtown!). The construction was also the reason why the parking was a bit far, making carrying things (we had a cooler, etc) a hassle. 

Fred was very helpful. He left us good instructions on the place and the neighborhood. The wireless Internet was useful. The stereo was great. 

All in all, the place is a great deal and I would use it myself again and recommend to others as well. ",Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

But the workers didn't start making noise until 10am.  I give this place 5 stars because I can see beyond the construction.  All of Fred's neighbors were such nice people and so were their dogs. Say hi to Franky, Waco, Luby and many other puppies while your there. Fred had everything we could have needed and more.  His sense of design with furniture and art is enjoying to be around.  And I loved the interior color choices on the walls too.  I would defiantly stay at Fred's place again if I had the chance.    ",Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

The room was large and private with a comfortable bed and a good sized bathroom. The best feature was the deck which overlooked the back yard garden. The kitchen has a sunny alcove which was the perfect place to enjoy coffee in the morning and peek at the yards of neighboring homes.

Also, our ride for the liveSTRONG challenge took a little longer than expected due to some mishaps, and Fred was more than accomodating with our delay in checking out.
