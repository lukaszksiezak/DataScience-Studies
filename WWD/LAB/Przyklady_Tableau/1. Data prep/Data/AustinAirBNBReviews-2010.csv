6251,22326,1/1/2010,Christopher,Immaculately clean super spacious handsome view of the skyline from a great location on E. 6th...not sure what else to say! Fred was awesome and easy going and was flexible with our check out on New Year's day to help us get 2010 off to a fantastic start. I can't recommend it enough. Thanks Fred!,Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick
6251,24195,1/17/2010,Travis,This place was stellar! I've always rented from individuals instead of getting a hotel when I'm in Austin (Keep Austin Weird..) This was by far the most clean and comfortable spot I've stayed in. The view off the balcony is fantastic. Enjoy a bottle of Dom like we did and wear a smile on your face! Thanks again Fred!  ,Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

5456,24721,1/24/2010,Christine,I'm late in posting this but that is no indication of how my stay went.  it was fantastic!  Sylvia is more than accommodating just like everyone else has mentioned.  it's all true. not only did she pick me up downtown she took me to the airport for $10 and then when i realized i left my iphone in the apartment she went to GREAT lengths to send it back to me.  i almost had a panic attack when i realized i left it there but was only consoled in the fact that at least it was in very good hands.  the apartment itself was perfect with plenty of windows free coffee etc.  i would definitely stay again. Thanks Sylvia!  sorry for the late review.,Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

6251,28718,3/8/2010,Angie,Fred's place is great and he is an excellent host. We couldn't figure out the espresso machine so we sent him a text message for direction. Instead of just telling us how to fix it he went over while we were out set up the machine and left us a pound of coffee. It was like we were at the Ritz except our place was three times as big as a hotel room and came with a washer/dryer and a panini press. You can't go wrong chez Fred.,Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

They were very friendly and hospitable and went out of their way to make lists of area restaurants for me along with and other nice touches.

6251,30478,3/21/2010,Eric,"Great place - great host. I had never used airbnb before but stumbled on it out of a lack of available hotels around SXSW. 

The place was great - perfect size to comfortable stay with one other person. It helped on our expenses to have a kitchen.

Really good location for SXSW - when cabs are sparse it was only a 30 minute walk or 15 minute ride on a rickshaw.

She also brought us to a car rental station and to the airport at the end of our stay.She was always there  to answer all our questions. The appartment was perfectly located so we could really walk to 6th street and to other places in town were bands were playing. You do not need a car unless you want to go out of town.

My stay with Sylvia was definitely one of the high points of my trip. Her studio was cozy and I had a very good night's sleep. Sylvia definitely went out of her way to help me feel at home and comfortable and there's really nothing I could say that would do justice to her hospitality.

The house itself has everything we needed for our stay and enough space for the three of us to comfortably hang out. The beds were so comfortable and the house was so clean.

5456,71621,7/31/2010,Brande,Sylvia's place was clean and cozy.  I felt very safe because you go through two gates to get to the apartment plus she has dogs.  The best part was the location - right on the edge of downtown close enough to walk if you like or you can head up to the corner and catch the bus.  Definitely check out the bus schedule - we found Austin's public transportation to be great and really cheap - 2$ for an all day pass.  Sylvia was friendly and helpful gave us some great advice for finding real Austin food.  And she has a drawer full of menus and flyers and local buying guides and some classic VHS for when you want to chill out after a long day of exploring Austin.  Highly recommend. ,Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

Helpful to have the kitchen and a stash of coffee in the frig that Sylvia was kind enough to provide.  The only suggestion I would make is that the air conditionner was not powerful enough to handle August heat in Austin. I would recommend a larger unit that would also handle the kitchen and bathroom. The bedroom got a bit hot at night...Other than that a good place to rest your head.,Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

5456,83097,8/23/2010,Barb,"Sylvia was very nice informal and she was relaxed about when we arrived and when we left so we did not feel any stress as we found our way from the airport to her place or when it was time to pack up and leave.

The apartment is behind her historical home in its own little yard/garden. Because of its age it is a little rustic when it comes to water temp in the shower but it is cozy and cheerful. Anyone who likes historical homes (as I do) won't mind what is old but will find it charming.

The apartment was clean we had everything we needed plenty of space for the two of us plus lots of privacy and quiet. Sylvia made sure we had enough fans in the room in addition to the air conditioner which was really great for us because we are not acclimated to the hot humid Texas summers.

We did not use it but the kitchen also had anything we might have needed. 

The beds are soft which might be a concern for anyone with a bad back but we slept great and there were plenty of pillows (Yay!).

The property is in a good location not far from downtown an easy drive from and to the airport and it is also very close to a great Mexican cafe that stays open late serves the real deal Mexican food for Great prices all with really good service! We loved it.

It was  definitely very clean and stylish. Included free wifi Uverse tv ipod dock/radio. Owners Gina and Ken were as acommodating and cool as they could possibly be and were very easy to get in contact with prior to my stay. I've stayed at just about all hotels downtown over the past few years for various occasions(omni sfa radisson driskill etc.) and I really think this (particular place and overall concept)is a far better deal and highly recommend it.   ,Private Clarksville $160/nt ,89031,Gina

The house has everything you would need- comfortable beds and bedding kitchen with dishes and glasses and a tv with a vcr and a fun collection of movies!

I had 2 girlfriends come in from out of town for Austin City Limits 2010 and Sylvia had great local recommendations for us of things to do and places to eat.

Susan and Anthony were very gracious and helpful and served us a delicious breakfast every morning.  I highly recommend the room and the hosts!

The neighborhood didn't feel walkable on Sunday: many places were closed when I went out including the BBQ place mentioned in the guide.  I also didn't see anyone else ""walking"" near the place except people asking me for money.

The cottage fell short of our expectations considering we stayed in thrilling soco in an insect-free modern cabin for less money the two nights prior.

That said if you want to be in walking distance to the convention center and/or are in need of two beds this place could be worth a look.",Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia
6251,131197,11/1/2010,Andy,nice place pretty much as advertised.  Good location with good vibe. I would recommend.  The only negative and it is minor is that these lofts have cement floors (so they actually look and feel like a loft) so when the upstairs occupant puts on her heels before leaving for work you know it.,Beautiful 1200 SQFT East Side Loft!,13096,Frederick

Great location very clean stocked with everything you need (maps guides movies fiestaware plenty of towels hair dryer iron etc. etc. We ate out on the patio every morning surrounded by plants. There's wireless internet. Cute dogs. Plus the generosity of Sylvia. She's really a lovely lovely person and gave us tons of ideas for good cheap eats(Manuels' happy hour!) and was a general font of information. We rented bikes from her too which was super convenient. All in all a great stay. 
p.s. her neighborhood is really neat full of small bungalows an gallery bookstore a block away and a (closed temporarily) cafe located within a nursery a few blocks away. ",Walk to 6th St and Convention Ctr,8028,Sylvia

It was a wonderful introduction to Austin and I felt right at home the next morning when I used the closeby and convenient bus system to get around town.

I had only planned on staying about a month but ended up staying a few more weeks because the place was comfortable and the price was far better than a hotel.

When I arrived the place was clean and most everything I needed was provided.  During my stay one or two things needed to be fixed and Angele (the owner) was very helpful and responsive and all my needs were met in short order.

We didn't spend a whole lot of time in the apartment and unfortunately we didn't get to meet Sylvia but every possible need or want was expected and met. An unexpected plus were the beach towels provided they were perfect for the music festival when we were tired of standing and wanted to sit down. The only tiny suggestion I would make is to have a bath mat in the bathroom since the tiles get slippery with condensation after a shower.

At first I thought the location was a bit far from downtown but there's a bus route that is a mere 2-blocks from her house and it takes all of 10-minutes to get to The Capital. Biking in the area is great too; it's about a 15-minute bike ride to/from Downtown. Paddy was kind enough to drive me to a bike rental shop.

The neighborhood is a bit eclectic with a mixture of Austin locals artists and activists. I was fortunate to be there the same weekend as East Austin Studio Tours (EAST) which gave me a chance to explore that section of Austin.

For us this location was about a 20 minute walk from the AT&T Conference Center and/or UT campus so it is a decent location for an event at one of those locations.

The wifi and radio system worked great. The bookshelves have interesting locally focused books/movies/DVDs. Some historic greats (Johnny Cash at Austin City Limits) were complemented with updated local magazines and newspapers with info on fun things to see and do in Austin.

Their home is lovely and ideally situated.  We were traveling with our two dogs and our hosts not only made an exception for us but created a special package for us that included pet-sitting so that we could do some things on our own during our stay in Austin.  Our finicky ""mom-attached"" dogs went right to them as if they had found their long-lost loves.  Unreal!  And we all know...animals are wonderful judges of character!

We were so so happy that we did our research and elected the ""b&b"" approach over a hotel.  Our memories of this trip were deeply enriched because of our lovely host family.
